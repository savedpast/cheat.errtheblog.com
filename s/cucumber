=======

  INSTALL cucumber &amp; webrat (rspec rspec-rails)
  =============================================
  $ [sudo] gem install rspec rspec-rails cucumber webrat
  
  Starting from Cucumber 0.4.5 you will need the cucumber-rails gem

  INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
  ====================
  $ [sudo] gem install term-ansicolor treetop diff-lcs nokogiri
  
  
BOOTSTRAP THE APP
=================
  script/generate cucumber
  
  
HOW TO USE
==========
  
  RAILS
  =====
  # Generate a basic feature and its step file,
  # its better to make your own!
  script/generate feature post
  
  # run your features
  rake cucumber 
  
  # run a specific feature
  rake cucumber features/authentication.feature
  
  COMMAND LINE
  ============
  # run a specific scenario (this scenario starts on
  # line 5 of authentication.feature)
  cucumber features/authentication.feature:5
  
  
  SAMPLE FEATURE DEFINITION
  =========================
  Feature: [feature name]
    In order to [goal]
    As a [stakeholder]
    I want [behavior]

  BUILT-IN WEBRAT STEPS
  =====================
  Given I am on [page_name]

  When I go to [page_name]
  When I press &quot;[button]&quot;
  When I follow &quot;[link]&quot;
  When I follow &quot;[link]&quot; within &quot;[parent]&quot;
  When I fill in &quot;[field]&quot; with &quot;[value]&quot;
  When I fill in &quot;[value]&quot; for &quot;[field]&quot;
  When I fill in the following:
    | field | value |

  When I select &quot;[value]&quot; from &quot;[field]&quot;
  When I select &quot;[time]&quot; as the date and time
  When I select &quot;[datetime]&quot; as the &quot;[datetime_label]&quot; date and time
  When I select &quot;[time]&quot; as the time
  When I select &quot;[time]&quot; as the &quot;[time_label]&quot; time
  When I select &quot;[date]&quot; as the date
  When I select &quot;[date]&quot; as the &quot;[date_label]&quot; date
  When I check &quot;[field]&quot;
  When I uncheck &quot;[field]&quot;
  When I choose &quot;[field]&quot;
  When I attach the file &quot;[path]&quot; to &quot;[field]&quot;

  Then I should see &quot;[text]&quot;
  Then I should see &quot;[text]&quot; within &quot;[selector]&quot;
  Then I should not see &quot;[text]&quot;
  Then I should not see &quot;[text]&quot; within &quot;[selector]&quot;
  Then the &quot;[field]&quot; field should contain &quot;[value]&quot;
  Then the &quot;[field]&quot; field should not contain &quot;[value]&quot;
  Then the &quot;[label]&quot; checkbox should be checked
  Then the &quot;[label]&quot; checkbox should not be checked
  Then I should be on [page_name]
  Then show me the page


Developing with Cucumber and BDD
================================

  Business value and MMF
  ======================
  You should discuss the “In order to” part of the feature and pop the why stack max 5 times (ask why recursively) until you end up with one of the following business values:

  * Protect revenue
  * Increase revenue
  * Manage cost

  If you’re about to implement a feature that doesn’t support one of those values, chances are you’re about to implement a non-valuable feature. Consider tossing it altogether or pushing it down in your backlog. Focus on implementing the MMFs (Minimum Marketable Features) that will yield the most value.

  Outcomes and bottom-up scenarios
  ================================
  The value provided by a system is what you can get out of it – not what you put into it (Chris Matts said that). Just like the value is expressed at the top of a feature (In order to…), the value should be in the steps of a scenarios too, more precisely in the Then steps.

  When you’re writing a new scenario, I recommend you start with the formulation of the desired outcome. Write the Then steps first. Then write the When step to discover the action/operation and finally write the Given steps that need to be in place in order for the When/Then to make sense.
