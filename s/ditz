distributed version control systems like darcs and git. Ditz maintains an issue database file on disk, written in a line-based and human-editable format. This file is kept under version control, alongside project code.  Changes in issue state is handled by version control like code change: included as part of a commit, merged with changes from other developers, conflict-resolved in the standard manner, etc.

Ditz provides a simple, console-based interface for creating and updating the
issue database file, and some rudimentary HTML generation capabilities for producing world-readable status pages. It offers no central public method of
bug submission.
