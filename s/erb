  ERB provides an easy to use but powerful templating system for Ruby.
  Rails/RoR, the web application framework, uses ERB to create views.

RECOGNIZED TAGS

  ERB recognizes certain tags in the provided template and converts 
  them based on the rules below:

    &lt;% Ruby code -- inline with output %&gt;
    
    &lt;%= Ruby expression -- replace with result %&gt;
    
    &lt;%# comment -- ignored -- useful in testing %&gt;
    
    % a line of Ruby code -- treated as &lt;% line %&gt; (optional -- see ERB.new)
    
    %% replaced with % if first thing on a line and % processing is used
    
    &lt;%% or %%&gt; -- replace with &lt;% or %&gt; respectively

    &lt;%- and -%&gt; suppress leading and trailing whitespace, including the trailing newline, and can be used interchangeably with &lt;% and %&gt;.

  All other text is passed through ERB filtering unchanged. 

ALTERNATIVES

  There are a variety of templating solutions available in various Ruby projects:

    * ERBâ€˜s big brother, eRuby, works the same but is written in C for speed;
    * Erubis is a fast, secure, and very extensible implementation of eRuby
    * Amrita (smart at producing HTML/XML);
    * cs/Template (written in C for speed);
    * RDoc uses its own template engine, which can be reused elsewhere;
    * and others; search the RAA.</pre></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer">Powered by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
