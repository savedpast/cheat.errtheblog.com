:class_name - specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can’t be inferred from the association name. So has_one :author will by default be linked to the Author class, but if the real class name is Person, you’ll have to specify it with this option.

:conditions - specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a &quot;WHERE&quot; sql fragment, such as &quot;authorized = 1&quot;.

:order - specify the order from which the associated object will be picked at the top. Specified as an &quot;ORDER BY&quot; sql fragment, such as &quot;last_name, first_name DESC&quot;

:foreign_key - specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the associated class in lower-case and &quot;_id&quot; suffixed. So a Person class that makes a belongs_to association to a Boss class will use &quot;boss_id&quot; as the default foreign_key.

:counter_cache - caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through use of increment_counter and decrement_counter. The counter cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and decremented when it’s destroyed. This requires that a column named &quot;#{table_name}_count&quot; (such as comments_count for a belonging Comment class) is used on the associate class (such as a Post class). You can also specify a custom counter cache column by given that name instead of a true/false value to this option (e.g., :counter_cache =&gt; :my_custom_counter.)

:include - specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this object is loaded.

:polymorphic - specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing true.</pre></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer">Powered by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
