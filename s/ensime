It provides many features that are commonly found only in IDEs, such as live error-checking, symbol inspection, package/type browsing, and basic refactorings. ENSIME's architecture is client/server: a thin Emacs client communicates with an analysis server written in Scala. The client component is based heavily on the SLIME environment for Common Lisp - using the same Swank RPC protocol. The server component services these calls using an instance of the official Scala compiler, so the results should always be consistent with the commandline compiler.

                 r      Rebuild the project, incrementally.

COMPLETION

        TAB             Start completing a method/variable.

DEBUGGING

        C-c C-d &lt;?&gt; 
                 d      Start the debugger.
                 b      Set a breakpoint.
                 u      Clear a breakpoint.
                 r      Run the debugged class.
                 s      Step.
                 n      Step over.
                 c      Continue from a breakpoint.

GENERAL NAVIGATION

        M-.             Jump to definition of symbol under cursor.
                        (or Control+Left-Click)

        M-,             Pop back to previously visited position. 

        C-c C-v .       Select the surrounding syntactic context.
                        Subsequent taps of '.' and ',' will grow and shrink
                        the selection, respectively.

INSPECTOR

        C-c C-v v       Search globally for methods or types.
        C-c C-v i       Inspect the type of the expression under the cursor.
                        (or Control+Right-Click)

        C-c C-v p       Inspect the package of the current source file. 
        C-c C-v o       Inspect the project-package specified in .ensime
        C-c C-v r       List all references to the symbol under the cursor.

        .               Forward one page in the inspector history.
        ,               Backward one page in the inspector history. 

        C-n or TAB      Forward one link in the inspector. 
        C-p             Backward one link in the inspector. 

        Mouse Hover     Echo the type of the expression under the cursor.
        
REFACTORING

        C-c C-r &lt;?&gt;                
                 r      Rename the symbol at point.
                 o      Organize imports.
                 l      Extract local.
                 m      Extract method.
                 i      Inline local.
                 t      Add import for type at point.

SBT

        C-c C-v s       Switch to the sbt command-line (sbt projects only) 
        C-c C-v z       Switch to the scala interpreter,
                        with project classes in the classpath. 

TYPE CHECKING

        C-c C-v c       Typecheck the current file. 
        C-c C-v a       Typecheck all files in the project. 
        C-c C-v e       Show all errors and warnings in the project. 

        M-n             Go to the next compilation note in the current buffer. 
        M-p             Go to previous compilation note in the current buffer. 

        C-c C-v f       Format the current Scala source file. 
        C-c C-v u       Undo a refactoring or formatting change. 


ENSIME CONFIG

        M-x ensime              start ensime for the project

        M-x ensime-shutdown     stop ensime for the project

        M-x ensime-reload       Reload the .ensime file, recompile project.
                                Useful if you hit a server bug.

        M-x ensime-config-gen   Start automatic configuration file generator.</pre></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer">Powered by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
