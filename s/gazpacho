========
Gazpacho soup, usually simply referred to as gazpacho, is a cold Spanish soup originating in the Southern region of Andalusia. It is widely consumed throughout Spain, neighboring Portugal (where it is known as gaspacho) and certain Latin American countries. It descends from an ancient Andalusian concoction based on a combination of stale bread, garlic, olive oil, salt, and vinegar â€” a cold breadsoup. With the Columbian Exchange beginning in 1492, the tomato and the bell pepper were brought to Europe.
