To get you started, add this line to your startup file: 
 (autoload 'svn-status &quot;dsvn&quot; &quot;Run `svn status'.&quot; t) 
 (autoload 'svn-update &quot;dsvn&quot; &quot;Run `svn update'.&quot; t) 

This file integrates well with vc-svn, so you might want to do this 
as well: 
  (require 'vc-svn) 

To get the status view, type 
  M-x svn-status 

Navigate through the file list using &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, for next and 
previous file, respectively. 

You can get a summary of available commands by typing &quot;?&quot;. 

Some commands operate on files, and can either operate on the file 
under point, or on a group of files that have been marked. 

The commands used for marking a file are the following: 
  m mark and go down 
  DEL unmark and go up 
  u unmark and go down 
  SPC toggle mark 
  M-DEL unmark all 

The commands that operate on files are: 
  f Visit the file under point (does not use marks) 
  o Visit the file under point in another window (does not use marks) 
  = Show diff of uncommitted changes. This does not use marks 
           unless you give a prefix argument (C-u) 
  c Commit files 
  a Add files 
  r Remove files 
  R Resolve conflicts 
  M Rename/move files 
  U Revert files 
  P View or edit properties of the file or directory under point 
           (does not use marks) 

These commands update what is shown in the status buffer: 
  g Rerun &quot;svn status&quot; to update the list. Use a prefix 
           argument (C-u) to clear the list first to make sure that 
           it is correct. 
  s Update status of selected files 
  S Show status of specific file or directory 
  x Expunge unchanged files from the list 

To update the working copy: 
  M-u Run &quot;svn update&quot;. If a prefix argument is given (C-u), 
           you will be prompted for a revision to update to. 
  M-s Switch working copy to another branch. 
  M-m Merge in changes using &quot;svn merge&quot;. 

To view the Subversion log type &quot;M-x svn-log&quot;. </pre></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer">Powered by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
