 -- Show all connections

lsof -iTCP
 -- Show only TCP connections (works the same for UDP)

lsof -i :22
 -- -i :port shows all networking related to a given port

lsof -i@192.168.1.5
 -- To show connections to a specific host, use @host

lsof -i@192.168.1.5:22
 -- Show connections based on the host and the port using @host:port

lsof -i| grep LISTEN
 -- Grepping for &quot;LISTEN&quot; shows what ports your system is waiting for connections on

lsof -i| grep ESTABLISHED
 -- Grepping for &quot;ESTABLISHED&quot; shows current active connections

lsof -u ecable
 -- Show what a given user has open using -u

lsof -c syslog-ng
 -- See what files and network connections a command is using with -c

lsof /var/log/messages
 -- Pointing to a file shows what's interacting with that file

lsof -p 10075
 -- The -p switch lets you see what a given process ID has open, which is good for learning more about unknown processes

lsof -t -c Mail
 -- The -t option returns just a PID

lsof -a -u ecable -i @1.1.1.1
 -- Using-a allows you to combine search terms, so the query below says, &quot;show me everything running as daniel connected to 1.1.1.1&quot;

kill -HUP `lsof -t -c sshd`
 -- Using the -t and -c options together you can HUP processes

kill -9 `lsof -t -u daniel`
 -- You can also use the -t with -u to kill everything a user has open

lsof +L1
 -- lsof +L1 shows you all open files that have a link count less than 1, often indicative of a cracker trying to hide something</pre></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer">Powered by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
