assert_response(type, message = nil)

Asserts that the response is one of the following types:

    * :success - Status code was 200
    * :redirect - Status code was in the 300-399 range
    * :missing - Status code was 404
    * :error - Status code was in the 500-599 range

You can also pass an explicit status number like assert_response(501) or its symbolic equivalent assert_response(:not_implemented). See ActionController::StatusCodes for a full list.

Examples

  # assert that the response was a redirection
  assert_response :redirect

  # assert that the response code was status code 401 (unauthorized)
  assert_response 401</pre></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer">Powered by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
