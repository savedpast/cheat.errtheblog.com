E:nth-last-of-type(n)   an E element, the n-th sibling of its type, counting from the last one

E ~ F                   an F element preceded by an E element 

Scraper.scrape(source, options?) =&gt; result

  Scrapes source and returns the result. Source is one of:
    String        HTML content: parse and scrape.
    URI           Page URL: read, parse and scrape.
    HTML::Node    Element or document, for use with structures.

  Options for reading: :last_modified, :etag, :redirect_limit, :user_agent, :timeout.
  Options for parsing: :root_element, :parser, :parser_options.

process(selector, *values, extractor?) { |element| .... }
process(symbol?, selector, *values, extractor?) { |element| ... }

  Use selector to select elements, and extractor to extract and store values. Pass each selected element to the block. Block can be used instead of or in combination with extractors.

  Extract value from (see more options in API):
    :element      Element itself
    :text         Text value of element
    Class         Another scraper
    &quot;elem&quot;        Element if name matches
    &quot;@attr&quot;       Attribute if specified
    &quot;elem@attr&quot;   Attribute if specified on element
    [value, ...]  First value that matches

  Extract value to (more options in API):
    symbol        Instance variable (e.g. :title to @title)
    symbol[]      Array instance variable (e.g. &quot;links[]&quot;)
    :skip         If true, do not further process this element

  Attribute accessors defined for each symbol used.
  If first argument is symbol, uses that name to replace any other processing rule with same name.

process_first(selector, *values, extractor?) { |element| .... }
process_first(symbol?, selector, *values, extractor?) { |element| ... }

  Similar to process but only processes the first selected element (if more than one).

result(*symbols)

  Specifies which instance variables to return. One symbol: return value of that variable. Multiple symbols: return object with suitable accessors.

array(*symbols)

  Specifies which instance variables are arrays. Otherwise, stores only last extracted value.

selector(symbol, selector, *values)
selector(symbol?, selector, *values) { |elements| ... }

  Defines selector method with the given name (symbol) that takes an element as argument and returns array of selected elements, empty if no elements selected. Defines first_ method that returns the first selected element or nil.

Instance Methods

  extracted         True if any processing rule returned true (also extracted = true/false).
  skip(element?)    Do not further process element. See also :skip=&amp;gt;true.
  stop()            Stop processing.
  prepare(document) Called on document before any processing.
  collect()         Called after processing is done.
  result()          Called to return result. By default returns self if extracted. You can override method, or redefine with class method result.</pre></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer">Powered by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
