Excerpts from the Official Rules of Ultimate: 11th Edition

From the Preface: &quot;The integrity of Ultimate depends on each player's
responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility
should remain paramount.&quot;

From Section 1: &quot;Ultimate relies upon a spirit of sportsmanship that places
the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is
encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors,
adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play. Protection of
these vital elements serves to eliminate unsportsmanlike conduct from the
Ultimate field. Such actions as taunting opposing players, dangerous
aggression, belligerent intimidation, intentional infractions, or other
'win-at-all-costs' behavior are contrary to the Spirit of the Game and must
be avoided by all players.&quot;
