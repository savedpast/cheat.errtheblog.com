Command completion
------------------

Fish gives you very good default completions. For example it will complete hostnames from your .ssh/known_hosts. For example, if you want to ssh into your account on host foo.example.com and you have connected to this host before, you can type

  ssh foo&lt;tab&gt;

and Fish will let you complete the host name from there.

Fish has a different take on completing commands from your history than other (eg. Bash) shells. Instead of having you type cryptic key combinations like cmd-R which takes you to an emacs-like minibuffer, Fish lets you use the arrow up-key and will complete the command from your history based on what you typed.

  $ cd /path/to/silly/directory
  $ make
  $ cd 
  $ cd /&lt;up-arrow&gt;

The last line in the example above will let you jump through your command history and match all commands you have typed that begin with &quot;cd /&quot;. If the first match wasn't what you were looking for, press up arrow again and Fish will keep trying. 

Fish also has builtin command completion for a lot of applications; after installing fish just try hitting tab after a command name and see if it doesn't suggest something relevant for you.
