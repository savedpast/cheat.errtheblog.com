rails_model: ! "rails generate model\n\n\nStubs out a new model. Pass the model name,
  either CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.\n\nAttribute
  pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the model's attributes. Timestamps
  are added by default, so you don't have to specify them by hand as created_at:datetime
  updated_at:datetime.\n\nThis generates a model class in app/models, a unit test
  in test/unit, a test fixture in test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a migration
  in db/migrate.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n  rails generate model account\n\n    creates an
  Account model, test, fixture, and migration:\n\n      Model:      app/models/account.rb\n
  \     Test:       test/unit/account_test.rb\n      Fixtures:   test/fixtures/accounts.yml\n
  \     Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_accounts.rb\n\n\n  rails generate model post
  title:string body:text published:boolean\n\n    creates a Post model with a string
  title, text body, and published flag."
