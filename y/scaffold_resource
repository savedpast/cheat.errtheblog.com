scaffold_resource: ! "REST\n$ ruby script/generate scaffold_resource Model columnname:columntype
  --skip-migration\n\n\nThe Payoff:\n * You get a starter set of functional tests
  for your controller. Keep your tests passing and you'll know your REST design is
  still intact.\n * A controller named Products with all of the canonical CRUD actions
  defined for you with boilerplate code. Comments with the routing paths (url pattern
  + http verb) to invoke that action. An HTTP XML API defined.\n * Boilerplate views
  for four of the CRUD actions (you'll just need to fill in your model's details in
  the forms).\n * A migration script. Define your table here, then run rake db:migrate.\n
  * map.resources :models line at the top of routes.rb."
