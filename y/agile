agile: ! "Agile Manifesto_____________\n - Individuals and interactions over processes
  and tools \n - Working software over comprehensive documentation  \n - Customer
  collaboration over contract negotiation \n - Responding to change over following
  a plan \n\n  While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
  on the left more. \n\nAgile Principles____________\n\nOur highest priority is to
  satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n\nWelcome
  changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change
  for the customer's competitive advantage.\n\nDeliver working software frequently,
  from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n\nBusiness
  people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. \n\nBuild
  projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they
  need, and trust them to get the job done. \n\nThe most efficient and effective method
  of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
  \n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress. \n\nAgile processes promote
  sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain
  a constant pace indefinitely. \n\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and
  good design enhances agility. \n\nSimplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of
  work not done--is essential. \n\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs
  emerge from self- \norganizing teams. \n\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects
  on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
