  Four Habits\n-------------\n1. Collect\n  * Write down any tasks, ideas, projects,
  or other information that pop into your head.\n  * Get it out of your head and onto
  paper.\n\n2. Process\n * Make quick decisions on things in your inbox, do not put
  them off.\n * Do it!, Trash it, Delegate it, File it (someday/maybe), calendar for
  later\n\n3. Plan\n  *  Each day, create a list of 1-3 Most Important Tasks (your
  Big Rocks for the day) and be sure to accomplish them.\n  * Do your MITs early in
  the day to get them out of the way and enjoy the rest of the day.\n\n4. Do\n  *
  One task at a time, without distractions.\n  * This is one of the most important
  habits in ZTD: Select a task (preferably one of your MITs) and focus on it to the
  exclusion of all else."
