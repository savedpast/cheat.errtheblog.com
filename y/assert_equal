assert_equal: ! "# 'cheat assertions' for the rest\n\nassert_equal(expected, actual,
  message=nil)\n\nPasses if expected == +actual.\n\nNote that the ordering of arguments
  is important, since a helpful error message is generated when this one fails that
  tells you the values of expected and actual.\n\nExample:\n\n  assert_equal 'MY STRING',
  'my string'.upcase"
