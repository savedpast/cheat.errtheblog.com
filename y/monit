monit: ! 'Debugging

  ---------

  Sometimes is hard to debug monit. If you want to simulate the PATH that monit uses,
  you can do "env -i PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin /bin/sh" in your bash console
  and then call the command that you want to debug, maybe some start program value
  from your monitrc.'
