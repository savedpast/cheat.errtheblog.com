ssh: ! "Authenticating via key pair (password-less)\n\nconnecting from client to server
  (all command lines are run from the client)\n\n create the key pair (ALWAYS give
  a strong password)\n  $ ssh-keygen\n\n create the key pair (DSA)\n  $ ssh-keygen
  -t dsa -b 1024 \n\n authorize client's key with server\n  $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  | ssh user@server \\\n        'mkdir ~/.ssh; touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys;\n         chmod
  a=,u=Xrw -R ~/.ssh;\n         cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'\n\nAfter that, you
  should be able to login to server using the password that you used to encrypt your
  private key.  If you password protected your private key (strongly recommended),
  then you should run ssh-agent within your session, and then add the key to the agent:\n\n
  see if ssh-agent is running (some systems start it up by default)\n  $ ps `echo
  $SSH_AGENT_PID`\n\n if ssh-agent isn't running\n  $ eval `ssh-agent`\n or find a
  way to run it when your login session starts\n\n add your key to the agent\n  $
  ssh-add\n\nAfter that, you should not need to type the password again during this
  session.\n\nSee http://uwstopia.nl/blog/2006/08/password-hell-gdm-ssh-gnome-keyring
  to make ssh-add unnecessary.\n\n\nSSH Tunnels\n\nBasic:\n$ ssh -fN -L localport:destination:destport
  user@remotehost\n\nReverse:\n$ ssh -fN -R remoteport:localhost:localport user@remotehost\n\nReverse,
  bound to all interfaces on remotehost:\n$ ssh -fN -R *:remoteport:localhost:localport
  user@remotehost\n(this requires \"GatewayPorts yes\" to be set in sshd_config on
  remotehost)\n\nExamples:\n\nTo allow anonymous access to mongrel on localhost, without
  network-level port forwarding:\n$ ssh -fN -R *:8080:localhost:3000 user@remotehost\nAny
  requests to http://remotehost:8080 will be forwarded to localhost 3000."
