assert_no_difference: ! "assert_no_difference -- an assertion for your testing suite\n\nUsage:\n
  \ assert_no_difference 'Model.count' do\n    puts \"blah\"\n  end\n\nSynonym for:\n
  \ assert_difference 'Model.count', 0 do\n    puts \"blah\" #or any action that will
  NOT change the argument.\n  end\n\nThis is useful for when you are testing benign
  actions or, even better, when you have fail-safes that allow an action to be executed
  but do not actually affect the database.\nFor instance, you've got an action that
  is protected by authentication and you don't want to broadcast its existance to
  anyone with lesser permissions.  If an unauthenticated\nuse navigates to the action,
  just let them see nothing (render :nothing => true or something to that effect)
  and chug along without caring."
