piston: ! "Piston (http://piston.rubyforge.org/usage.html) is a tool for keeping bits
  and pieces of your Subversion repository in sync with a remote repository. Like
  svn:externals, but better. How?\n\nWith Piston, you import a remote repository and
  check it into your local repository. You can then go nuts modifying it or periodically
  sync it up with its remote origin using piston update.\n\nAll of the examples use
  the vendor/rails directory. But piston works on any directory that you would use
  svn:externals with (IE Other plugin directories).\n\nNote that for some commands
  to work you must first commit the imported files into your repository.\n\nInstall:\n
  \ gem install piston -y\n\nImport:\n  piston import http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk
  vendor/rails\n\nUpdate:\n  piston update vendor/rails\n\nLock (doesn't allow updates):\n
  \ piston lock vendor/rails\n\nUnlock:\n  piston unlock vendor/rails\n\nStatus:\n
  \ piston status vendor/rails"
