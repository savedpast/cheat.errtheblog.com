mongoruby: ! "Here's what you wrote, so it isn't lost in the void:\n- (Hash, true)
  update(selector, document, opts = {})\n\n  Update one or more documents in this
  collection.\n\n  Parameters:\n    selector (Hash) — a hash specifying elements which
  must be present for a document to be updated. Note: the update command currently
  updates only the first document matching the given selector. If you want all matching
  documents to be updated, be sure to specify :multi => true.\n    \n    document
  (Hash) — a hash specifying the fields to be changed in the selected document, or
  (in the case of an upsert) the document to be inserted\n    \n    opts (Hash) (defaults
  to: {}) — a customizable set of options\n      Options Hash (opts):\n      :upsert
  (Boolean) — default: +false+ — if true, performs an upsert (update or insert)\n
  \     :multi (Boolean) — default: +false+ — update all documents matching the selector,
  as opposed to just the first matching document. Note: only works in MongoDB 1.1.3
  or later.\n      :safe (Boolean) — default: +false+ — If true, check that the save
  succeeded. OperationFailure will be raised on an error. Note that a safe check requires
  an extra round-trip to the database. Safe options provided here will override any
  safe options set on this collection, its database object, or the current collection.
  See the options for DB#get_last_error for details.\n      \n  Returns: (Hash, true)
  — Returns a Hash containing the last error object if running in safe mode. Otherwise,
  returns true.\n  \n  Examples:\n    Scheduling::Task.collection.update({\n      '_type'
  => 'RecurringTask'\n      }, {:$set => {'_type' => 'Scheduling::RecurringTask'}},
  {:multi => true})\n\n    Scheduling::Task.collection.update({\n      '_type' =>
  'CounterTask'\n      }, {:$set => {'_type' => 'Scheduling::CounterTask'}}, {:multi
  => true})\n    \n    The following example illustrates how to rename fields through
  'update' command,\n    notice that old name and new name must be strings(symbols
  doesn't work)\n    MonitorProfile.collection.update({\n         :connections =>
  { :$exists => true}\n       }, {\n         :$rename => {'connections' => 'connectivities'}\n
  \      }, {\n         :multi => true\n       })\n      \n      \n- (String) rename(new_name)\n\nRename
  this collection.\n\nNote: If operating in auth mode, the client must be authorized
  as an admin to perform this operation.\n\nParameters:\n  new_name (String) — the
  new name for this collection\nReturns:\n  (String) — the name of the new collection.\nRaises:\n
  \ (Mongo::InvalidNSName) — if new_name is an invalid collection name.\nExamples:\n
  \ MonitorTask.collection.rename('scheduling_tasks')\n  When collection name is renamed,
  the name of corresponding model class is usually renamed, so getting the \n  collection
  class through model class is not realistic, the following example is based on MongoID:\n
  \ Mongoid.master.collection(:monitor_tasks).rename(:scheduling_tasks)"
