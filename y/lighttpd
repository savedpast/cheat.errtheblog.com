  __host__ is ip of the FastCGI process (no support for hostnames right now)\n* __port__
  is tcp-port on the \"host\" used by the FastCGI process\n* __socket__ path to the
  unix-domain socket\n\n> Either __host__ and __port__ or __socket__ must be provided.\n\n*
  __bin-path__ path to the local FastCGI binary which should be started if\n  no local
  FastCGI is running\n* __mode__ is the FastCGI protocol mode. Default is \"responder\",
  also\n  \"authorizer\" mode is implemented.\n* __docroot__ is the docroot on the
  remote host for default \"responder\" mode.\n  For \"authorizer\" mode it is _mandatory_
  and it points to docroot for\n  authorized requests. For security reasons it is
  recommended to keep this\n  docroot outside of server.document-root tree.\n* __check-local__
  is optional and may be \"enable\" (default) or \"disable\".\n  If enabled the server
  first checks for a file in local 'server.document-root'\n  tree and returns 404
  (Not Found) if no such file, and does not fall back to\n  FastCGI. If disabled,
  the server forwards a request to the FastCGI interface\n  without this check."
