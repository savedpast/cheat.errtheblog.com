git_flow: ! "GIT FLOW\r\n========\r\n\r\nGit extensions to provide high-level repository
  operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model. â€” Read more:\r\nhttp://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\r\n\r\nINIT:\r\n$
  git flow init\r\n\r\nTRACK DEVELOP REMOTELY ON GITHUB:\r\n$ git push origin develop\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\nUse
  to develop new features starting from the develop branch. Merge back into develop
  branch waiting for a reasonable amount of features to be there before declaring
  it a release.\r\n$ git flow feature\r\n$ git flow feature start <name>\r\n$ git
  flow feature finish <name>\r\n\r\nRELEASES:\r\nUse to group together latest development
  (features) add a few finishing touches if necessary and send to production. All
  last changes will merge back to master and develop so new features will start from
  current release.\r\n$ git flow release\r\n$ git flow release start <release> [<base>]\r\n$
  git flow release finish <release>\r\n\r\nHOTFIXES:\r\nSimilar to releases but the
  hotfix branch starts off master to avoid unvoluntary send to production of unwanted
  features that my be present in branches. The quick fix must be used when an important
  bug arises in production which must be fixed and can't wait for other features to
  be ready. It merges back to master and develop.\r\n$ git flow hotfix\r\n$ git flow
  hotfix start <release> [<base>]\r\n$ git flow hotfix finish <release>"
