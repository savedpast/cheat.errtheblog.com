  to operate on. Operations can\nincluding killing / deleting, copying, re-indenting,
  counting lines,\netc. Normally, you select a region by placing a 'mark' at one end-point
  of the\nregion you want, and moving the point (or cursor) to the other end before\ninvoking
  the command you want.\n\nC-SPC    set-mark-command. Places a mark at the current
  point or cursor\n         position.\nC-x C-x  exchange-point-and-mark. Move between
  the current position and the\n         mark.\nC-x h    mark-whole-buffer. Mark the
  entire buffer.\nC-M-SPC  mark-sexp. Mark the expression following the point.\n\n\nCopying,
  Deleting, Killing and Yanking\n\nDeletion means to remove text from the buffer without
  saving it.  Killing\nmeans to save the removed text, so that it can be yanked back
  later someplace\nelse.\n\nC-d            delete-char. Deletes the character to the
  right of (under, if\n\t       the cursor is a block that covers a character) the
  cursor. \nDEL or C-?     delete-backward-char. Deletes the character to the left
  of the\n               cursor. \nC-y            yank. Yanks text, inserting whatever
  text you killed last.\nC-w            kill-region. Kills the region of text between
  the point and the\n               cursor.\nM-w            kill-ring-save. Save the
  region as if killed, but don't kill\n               it. AKA Copy.\nC-M-w          append-next-kill.
  If the next command kills text, append it to\n               the last thing killed
  instead of replaceing it.\nM-d            kill-word. Kills to the end of the word
  to the right of the\n               cursor (forward). \nM-DEL          backward-kill-word.
  Kills to the beginning of the word to the\n               left of the cursor (backward).
  \nC-k            kill-line. Kills to the end of the current line.\nC-u 0 C-k      kill-line.
  Kills to the beginning of the current line.\nC-u -1 C-k     kill-line. Kills to
  the beginning of the current line, and\n               previous newline character.\nM-k
  \           kill-sentence. Kills to the end of the current sentence.\nC-u -1 M-k
  \    kill-sentence. Kills to the beginning of the current sentence.\nC-M-k          kill-sexp.
  Kills the sexp after the cursor.\nC-u -1 C-M-k   kill-sexp. Kills the sexp before
  the cursor.\n\n\nHelp\n\nC-h a   command-apropos.  List commands matching the given
  name or regexp.\nC-h f   describe-function.  Show documentation on the given function.\nC-h
  v   describe-variable.  Show documentation on the given variable.\nC-h c   describe-key-briefly.
  \ Name the function bound to the given key\n        sequence.\nC-h k   describe-key.
  \ Show documentation for the function bound to the given\n        key sequence.\nC-h
  w   where-is.      Show key sequences bound to the given command name.\nC-h m   describe-mode.
  Documentation on the current major mode.\nC-h l   view-lossage.  Show the last 100
  keystrokes.\n\nC-h after any prefix key will display all available shortcuts under
  that prefix.\n\nFrom http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html"
