yum: ! "15 Linux Yum Command Examples – Install, Uninstall, Update Packages\n\nInstalling,
  removing, and updating packages is a typical activity on Linux. Most of the Linux
  distributions provides some kind of package manager utility. For example, apt-get,
  dpkg, rpm, yum, etc. \n\n\n1. Install a package using yum install \nTo install a
  package, do ‘yum install packagename’. This will also identify the dependencies
  automatically and install them. \nThe following example installs postgresql package.
  \n\n# yum install postgresql.x86_64 \nor by using the -y flag you answer yes to
  all checks automatically\n# yum -y install postgresql.x86_64 \nResolving Dependencies
  \nInstall       2 Package(s) \nIs this ok [y/N]: y \n\nPackage(s) data still to
  download: 3.0 M \n(1/2): postgresql-9.0.4-5.fc15.x86_64.rpm          | 2.8 MB     00:11
  \n(2/2): postgresql-libs-9.0.4-5.fc15.x86_64.rpm    | 203 kB     00:00 \n------------------------------------------------------------------

  a package using yum remove \nTo remove a package (along with all its dependencies),
  use ‘yum remove package’ as shown below. \n\n# yum remove  postgresql.x86_64 \nResolving
  Dependencies \n---> Package postgresql.x86_64 0:9.0.4-5.fc15 will be erased \n\nIs
  this ok [y/N]: y \n\nRunning Transaction \nErasing    : postgresql-9.0.4-5.fc15.x86_64
  \      1/1 \n\nRemoved: \npostgresql.x86_64 0:9.0.4-5.fc15 \n\n\n3. Upgrade an existing
  package using yum update \nIf you have a older version of a package, use ‘yum update
  package’ to upgrade it to the latest current version. This will also identify and
  install all required dependencies. \n\n# yum update postgresql.x86_64 \n\n\n4. Search
  for a package to be installed using yum search \nIf you don’t know the exact package
  name to be installed, use ‘yum search keyword’, which will search all the packages
  that matches the ‘keyword’ and display it. \nThe following examples searches the
  yum repository for all the packages that matches the keyword ‘firefox’ and lists
  the available packages. \n\n# yum search firefox \nLoaded plugins: langpacks, presto,
  refresh-packagekit \n============== N/S Matched: firefox ======================
  \nfirefox.x86_64 : Mozilla Firefox Web browser \ngnome-do-plugins-firefox.x86_64
  : gnome-do-plugins for firefox \nmozilla-firetray-firefox.x86_64 : System tray extension
  for firefox \nmozilla-adblockplus.noarch : Adblocking extension for Mozilla Firefox
  \nmozilla-noscript.noarch : JavaScript white list extension for Mozilla Firefox
  \n\nName and summary matches only, use \"search all\" for everything. \n\n\n5. Display
  additional information about a package using yum info \nOnce you search for a package
  using yum search, you can use ‘yum info package’ to view additional information
  about the package. \nThe following examples displays additional information about
  the samba-common package. \n\n# yum info samba-common.i686 \nLoaded plugins: langpacks,
  presto, refresh-packagekit \n    Available Packages \n    Name        : samba-common
  \n    Arch        : i686 \n    Epoch       : 1 \n    Version     : 3.5.11 \n    Release
  \    : 71.fc15.1 \n    Size        : 9.9 M \n    Repo        : updates \n    Summary
  \    : Files used by both Samba servers and clients \n    URL         : http://www.samba.org/
  \n    License     : GPLv3+ and LGPLv3+ \n    Description : Samba-common provides
  files necessary for both the server and client \n\n\n6. View all available packages
  using yum list \n\n The following command will list all the packages available in
  the yum database. \n\n# yum list | less \n7. List only the installed packages using
  yum list installed \n\no view all the packages that are installed on your system,
  execute the following yum command. \n\n # yum list installed | less \n8. Which package
  does a file belong to? – Use yum provides \n\nUse ‘yum provides’ if you like to
  know which package a particular file belongs to. For example, if you like to know
  the name of the package that has the /etc/sysconfig/nfs file, do the following.
  \n\n # yum provides /etc/sysconfig/nfs \n Loaded plugins: langpacks, presto, refresh-packagekit

  List available software groups using yum grouplist \n\n                                                                                                                     In
  yum, several related packages are grouped together in a specific group. Instead
  of searching and installing all the individual packages that belongs to a specific
  function, you can simply install the group, which will install all the packages
  that belongs to the group. \n\n                                                                                                                     To
  view all the available software groups execute ‘yum grouplist’ as shown below. The
  output is listed in three groups–Installed Groups, Installed Language Groups and
  Available Groups. \n\n                                                                                                                     #

  can also read commands from a text file and execute it one by one. This is very

  execute those commands as shown below. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  #
