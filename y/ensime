ensime: ! "\"ENSIME is the ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for Emacs.\"\n\nIt provides
  many features that are commonly found only in IDEs, such as live error-checking,
  symbol inspection, package/type browsing, and basic refactorings. ENSIME's architecture
  is client/server: a thin Emacs client communicates with an analysis server written
  in Scala. The client component is based heavily on the SLIME environment for Common
  Lisp - using the same Swank RPC protocol. The server component services these calls
  using an instance of the official Scala compiler, so the results should always be
  consistent with the commandline compiler.\n\nMANUAL\n\n    http://aemon.com/file_dump/ensime_manual.html\n\nBUILDING\n\n
  \       C-c C-b <?>                \n                 b      Build the entire project.\n
  \                r      Rebuild the project, incrementally.\n\nCOMPLETION\n\n        TAB
  \            Start completing a method/variable.\n\nDEBUGGING\n\n        C-c C-d
  <?> \n                 d      Start the debugger.\n                 b      Set a
  breakpoint.\n                 u      Clear a breakpoint.\n                 r      Run
  the debugged class.\n                 s      Step.\n                 n      Step
  over.\n                 c      Continue from a breakpoint.\n                 q      Kill
  the debug session.\n                 l      List the local variables at current
  line.\n\nGENERAL NAVIGATION\n\n        M-.             Jump to definition of symbol
  under cursor.\n                        (or Control+Left-Click)\n\n        M-,             Pop
  back to previously visited position. \n\n        C-c C-v .       Select the surrounding
  syntactic context.\n                        Subsequent taps of '.' and ',' will
  grow and shrink\n                        the selection, respectively.\n\nINSPECTOR\n\n
  \       C-c C-v v       Search globally for methods or types.\n        C-c C-v i
  \      Inspect the type of the expression under the cursor.\n                        (or
  Control+Right-Click)\n\n        C-c C-v p       Inspect the package of the current
  source file. \n        C-c C-v o       Inspect the project-package specified in
  .ensime\n        C-c C-v r       List all references to the symbol under the cursor.\n\n
  \       .               Forward one page in the inspector history.\n        ,               Backward
  one page in the inspector history. \n\n        C-n or TAB      Forward one link
  in the inspector. \n        C-p             Backward one link in the inspector.
  \n\n        Mouse Hover     Echo the type of the expression under the cursor.\n
  \       \nREFACTORING\n\n        C-c C-r <?>                \n                 r
  \     Rename the symbol at point.\n                 o      Organize imports.\n                 l
  \     Extract local.\n                 m      Extract method.\n                 i
  \     Inline local.\n                 t      Add import for type at point.\n\nSBT\n\n
  \       C-c C-v s       Switch to the sbt command-line (sbt projects only) \n        C-c
  C-v z       Switch to the scala interpreter,\n                        with project
  classes in the classpath. \n\nTYPE CHECKING\n\n        C-c C-v c       Typecheck
  the current file. \n        C-c C-v a       Typecheck all files in the project.
  \n        C-c C-v e       Show all errors and warnings in the project. \n\n        M-n
  \            Go to the next compilation note in the current buffer. \n        M-p
  \            Go to previous compilation note in the current buffer. \n\n        C-c
  C-v f       Format the current Scala source file. \n        C-c C-v u       Undo
  a refactoring or formatting change. \n\n\nENSIME CONFIG\n\n        M-x ensime              start
  ensime for the project\n\n        M-x ensime-shutdown     stop ensime for the project\n\n
  \       M-x ensime-reload       Reload the .ensime file, recompile project.\n                                Useful
  if you hit a server bug.\n\n        M-x ensime-config-gen   Start automatic configuration
  file generator."
