pola_violations: ! "POLA/PLA\n--------\nPOLA or PLA, the priniciple of least astonishment
  is documented at\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment\n\nRuby
  definitely scores on this front. It surprises the programmer the least. But still,
  there are some quirks. This cheat sheet is an attempt to list Ruby's violations
  of POLA. Of course, the list  may be personal.\n\n1. String#to_i -- as of Ruby 1.9.2
  returns 0 when the receiver does not start with numerics!  (Naturally, it returns
  0 also when receiver is \"0\").\n\n   I'd have preferred nil to be returned in this
  case. Of course, there are cases where a return value of 0 is useful (cases where
  non-numeric string should contribute nothing to an aggregate function), but still,
  this is a candidate for POLA violation.\n\n   See http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/78767
  for some interesting discussions and workarounds."
