bartleby: ! "BARTLEBY, THE SCRIVENER.\r\n\r\nA STORY OF WALL-STREET.\r\n\r\nI am a
  rather elderly man.  The nature of my avocations for the last\r\nthirty years has
  brought me into more than ordinary contact with what\r\nwould seem an interesting
  and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as\r\nyet nothing that I know of has ever
  been written:--I mean the\r\nlaw-copyists or scriveners.  I have known very many
  of them,\r\nprofessionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers\r\nhistories,
  at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental\r\nsouls might weep.
  \ But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners\r\nfor a few passages in the
  life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the\r\nstrangest I ever saw or heard of.
  \ While of other law-copyists I might\r\nwrite the complete life, of Bartleby nothing
  of that sort can be done.\r\nI believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory
  biography\r\nof this man.  It is an irreparable loss to literature.  Bartleby was
  one\r\nof those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the\r\noriginal
  sources, and in his case those are very small.  What my own\r\nastonished eyes saw
  of Bartleby, _that_ is all I know of him, except,\r\nindeed, one vague report which
  will appear in the sequel.\r\n\r\nEre introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared
  to me, it is fit I\r\nmake some mention of myself, my _employees_, my business,
  my chambers,\r\nand general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable\r\nto
  an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nImprimis:
  \ I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with\r\na profound conviction
  that the easiest way of life is the best.  Hence,\r\nthough I belong to a profession
  proverbially energetic and nervous, even\r\nto turbulence, at times, yet nothing
  of that sort have I ever suffered\r\nto invade my peace.  I am one of those unambitious
  lawyers who never\r\naddresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause;
  but in the\r\ncool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich
  men's\r\nbonds and mortgages and title-deeds.  All who know me, consider me an\r\neminently
  _safe_ man.  The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little\r\ngiven to poetic enthusiasm,
  had no hesitation in pronouncing my first\r\ngrand point to be prudence; my next,
  method.  I do not speak it in\r\nvanity, but simply record the fact, that I was
  not unemployed in my\r\nprofession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I
  admit, I love\r\nto repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and
  rings\r\nlike unto bullion.  I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the\r\nlate
  John Jacob Astor's good opinion.\r\n\r\nSome time prior to the period at which this
  little history begins, my\r\navocations had been largely increased.  The good old
  office, now extinct\r\nin the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been
  conferred\r\nupon me.  It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly\r\nremunerative.
  \ I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in\r\ndangerous indignation
  at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted to\r\nbe rash here and declare,
  that I consider the sudden and violent\r\nabrogation of the office of Master in
  Chancery, by the new Constitution,\r\nas a--premature act; inasmuch as I had counted
  upon a life-lease of the\r\nprofits, whereas I only received those of a few short
  years.  But this\r\nis by the way.\r\n\r\nMy chambers were up stairs at No.--Wall-street.
  \ At one end they looked\r\nupon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light
  shaft,\r\npenetrating the building from top to bottom.  This view might have been\r\nconsidered
  rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape\r\npainters call \"life.\"
  \ But if so, the view from the other end of my\r\nchambers offered, at least, a
  contrast, if nothing more.  In that\r\ndirection my windows commanded an unobstructed
  view of a lofty brick\r\nwall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required
  no\r\nspy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all\r\nnear-sighted
  spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window\r\npanes.  Owing to the
  great height of the surrounding buildings, and my\r\nchambers being on the second
  floor, the interval between this wall and\r\nmine not a little resembled a huge
  square cistern.\r\n\r\nAt the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had
  two persons\r\nas copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy.\r\nFirst,
  Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut.  These may seem\r\nnames, the like of
  which are not usually found in the Directory.  In\r\ntruth they were nicknames,
  mutually conferred upon each other by my\r\nthree clerks, and were deemed expressive
  of their respective persons or\r\ncharacters.  Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman
  of about my own age,\r\nthat is, somewhere not far from sixty.  In the morning,
  one might say,\r\nhis face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o'clock,\r\nmeridian--his
  dinner hour--it blazed like a grate full of Christmas\r\ncoals; and continued blazing--but,
  as it were, with a gradual wane--till\r\n6 o'clock, P.M. or thereabouts, after which
  I saw no more of the\r\nproprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with
  the sun, seemed\r\nto set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following
  day, with\r\nthe like regularity and undiminished glory.  There are many singular\r\ncoincidences
  I have known in the course of my life, not the least among\r\nwhich was the fact,
  that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams\r\nfrom his red and radiant
  countenance, just then, too, at that critical\r\nmoment, began the daily period
  when I considered his business capacities\r\nas seriously disturbed for the remainder
  of the twenty-four hours.  Not\r\nthat he was absolutely idle, or averse to business
  then; far from it.\r\nThe difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic.
  \ There\r\nwas a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity\r\nabout
  him.  He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand.\r\nAll his blots
  upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve\r\no'clock, meridian.  Indeed,
  not only would he be reckless and sadly\r\ngiven to making blots in the afternoon,
  but some days he went further,\r\nand was rather noisy.  At such times, too, his
  face flamed with\r\naugmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite.
  \ He\r\nmade an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in\r\nmending
  his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them\r\non the floor in
  a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table,\r\nboxing his papers about
  in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold\r\nin an elderly man like him.  Nevertheless,
  as he was in many ways a most\r\nvaluable person to me, and all the time before
  twelve o'clock, meridian,\r\nwas the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing
  a great deal of\r\nwork in a style not easy to be matched--for these reasons, I
  was willing\r\nto overlook his eccentricities, though indeed, occasionally, I\r\nremonstrated
  with him.  I did this very gently, however, because, though\r\nthe civilest, nay,
  the blandest and most reverential of men in the\r\nmorning, yet in the afternoon
  he was disposed, upon provocation, to be\r\nslightly rash with his tongue, in fact,
  insolent.  Now, valuing his\r\nmorning services as I did, and resolved not to lose
  them; yet, at the\r\nsame time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve
  o'clock;\r\nand being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to call forth\r\nunseemly
  retorts from him; I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was\r\nalways worse on Saturdays),
  to hint to him, very kindly, that perhaps\r\nnow that he was growing old, it might
  be well to abridge his labors; in\r\nshort, he need not come to my chambers after
  twelve o'clock, but, dinner\r\nover, had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself
  till teatime.\r\nBut no; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions.  His countenance\r\nbecame
  intolerably fervid, as he oratorically assured me--gesticulating\r\nwith a long
  ruler at the other end of the room--that if his services in\r\nthe morning were
  useful, how indispensable, then, in the afternoon?\r\n\r\n\"With submission, sir,\"
  said Turkey on this occasion, \"I consider myself\r\nyour right-hand man.  In the
  morning I but marshal and deploy my\r\ncolumns; but in the afternoon I put myself
  at their head, and gallantly\r\ncharge the foe, thus!\"--and he made a violent thrust
  with the ruler.\r\n\r\n\"But the blots, Turkey,\" intimated I.\r\n\r\n\"True,--but,
  with submission, sir, behold these hairs!  I am getting\r\nold.  Surely, sir, a
  blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be\r\nseverely urged against gray hairs.
  \ Old age--even if it blot the\r\npage--is honorable.  With submission, sir, we
  _both_ are getting old.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to
  be resisted.  At all\r\nevents, I saw that go he would not.  So I made up my mind
  to let him\r\nstay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon\r\nhe
  had to do with my less important papers.\r\n\r\nNippers, the second on my list,
  was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the\r\nwhole, rather piratical-looking young
  man of about five and twenty.  I\r\nalways deemed him the victim of two evil powers--ambition
  and\r\nindigestion.  The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the\r\nduties
  of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly\r\nprofessional affairs,
  such as the original drawing up of legal\r\ndocuments.  The indigestion seemed betokened
  in an occasional nervous\r\ntestiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth
  to audibly grind\r\ntogether over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions,\r\nhissed,
  rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by a\r\ncontinual discontent
  with the height of the table where he worked.\r\nThough of a very ingenious mechanical
  turn, Nippers could never get this\r\ntable to suit him.  He put chips under it,
  blocks of various sorts, bits\r\nof pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt
  an exquisite\r\nadjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper.  But no invention\r\nwould
  answer.  If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table\r\nlid at a sharp
  angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a\r\nman using the steep roof
  of a Dutch house for his desk:--then he\r\ndeclared that it stopped the circulation
  in his arms.  If now he lowered\r\nthe table to his waistbands, and stooped over
  it in writing, then there\r\nwas a sore aching in his back.  In short, the truth
  of the matter was,\r\nNippers knew not what he wanted.  Or, if he wanted any thing,
  it was to\r\nbe rid of a scrivener's table altogether.  Among the manifestations
  of\r\nhis diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from\r\ncertain
  ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his\r\nclients.  Indeed
  I was aware that not only was he, at times,\r\nconsiderable of a ward-politician,
  but he occasionally did a little\r\nbusiness at the Justices' courts, and was not
  unknown on the steps of\r\nthe Tombs.  I have good reason to believe, however, that
  one individual\r\nwho called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air,
  he\r\ninsisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged\r\ntitle-deed,
  a bill.  But with all his failings, and the annoyances he\r\ncaused me, Nippers,
  like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man to\r\nme; wrote a neat, swift
  hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient in a\r\ngentlemanly sort of deportment.
  \ Added to this, he always dressed in a\r\ngentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally,
  reflected credit upon my\r\nchambers.  Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much
  ado to keep him\r\nfrom being a reproach to me.  His clothes were apt to look oily
  and\r\nsmell of eating-houses.  He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in\r\nsummer.
  \ His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled.  But while\r\nthe hat was
  a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his natural\r\ncivility and deference,
  as a dependent Englishman, always led him to\r\ndoff it the moment he entered the
  room, yet his coat was another matter.\r\nConcerning his coats, I reasoned with
  him; but with no effect.  The\r\ntruth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an
  income, could not afford\r\nto sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at
  one and the same\r\ntime.  As Nippers once observed, Turkey's money went chiefly
  for red\r\nink.  One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable\r\nlooking
  coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable\r\nwarmth, and which buttoned
  straight up from the knee to the neck.  I\r\nthought Turkey would appreciate the
  favor, and abate his rashness and\r\nobstreperousness of afternoons.  But no.  I
  verily believe that\r\nbuttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat
  had a\r\npernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats\r\nare
  bad for horses.  In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said\r\nto feel
  his oats, so Turkey felt his coat.  It made him insolent.  He\r\nwas a man whom
  prosperity harmed.\r\n\r\nThough concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey
  I had my own\r\nprivate surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that\r\nwhatever
  might be his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a\r\ntemperate young man.
  \ But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his\r\nvintner, and at his birth
  charged him so thoroughly with an irritable,\r\nbrandy-like disposition, that all
  subsequent potations were needless.\r\nWhen I consider how, amid the stillness of
  my chambers, Nippers would\r\nsometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping
  over his table,\r\nspread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it,
  and jerk\r\nit, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were
  a\r\nperverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly\r\nperceive
  that for Nippers, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate
  for me that, owing to its peculiar\r\ncause--indigestion--the irritability and consequent
  nervousness of\r\nNippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon\r\nhe
  was comparatively mild.  So that Turkey's paroxysms only coming on\r\nabout twelve
  o'clock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at one\r\ntime.  Their fits
  relieved each other like guards.  When Nippers' was\r\non, Turkey's was off; and
  _vice versa_.  This was a good natural\r\narrangement under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nGinger
  Nut, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old.  His\r\nfather was a
  carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of\r\na cart, before he
  died.  So he sent him to my office as student at law,\r\nerrand boy, and cleaner
  and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week.\r\nHe had a little desk to himself,
  but he did not use it much.  Upon\r\ninspection, the drawer exhibited a great array
  of the shells of various\r\nsorts of nuts.  Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the
  whole noble\r\nscience of the law was contained in a nut-shell.  Not the least among\r\nthe
  employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with\r\nthe most alacrity,
  was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey\r\nand Nippers.  Copying law
  papers being proverbially dry, husky sort of\r\nbusiness, my two scriveners were
  fain to moisten their mouths very often\r\nwith Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous
  stalls nigh the Custom\r\nHouse and Post Office.  Also, they sent Ginger Nut very
  frequently for\r\nthat peculiar cake--small, flat, round, and very spicy--after
  which he\r\nhad been named by them.  Of a cold morning when business was but dull,\r\nTurkey
  would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere\r\nwafers--indeed they
  sell them at the rate of six or eight for a\r\npenny--the scrape of his pen blending
  with the crunching of the crisp\r\nparticles in his mouth.  Of all the fiery afternoon
  blunders and\r\nflurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once moistening a ginger-cake\r\nbetween
  his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal.  I came\r\nwithin an ace
  of dismissing him then.  But he mollified me by making an\r\noriental bow, and saying--\"With
  submission, sir, it was generous of me\r\nto find you in stationery on my own account.\"\r\n\r\nNow
  my original business--that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and\r\ndrawer-up of
  recondite documents of all sorts--was considerably\r\nincreased by receiving the
  master's office.  There was now great work\r\nfor scriveners.  Not only must I push
  the clerks already with me, but I\r\nmust have additional help.  In answer to my
  advertisement, a motionless\r\nyoung man one morning, stood upon my office threshold,
  the door being\r\nopen, for it was summer.  I can see that figure now--pallidly
  neat,\r\npitiably respectable, incurably forlorn!  It was Bartleby.\r\n\r\nAfter
  a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to\r\nhave among my
  corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect,\r\nwhich I thought might
  operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of\r\nTurkey, and the fiery one of
  Nippers.\r\n\r\nI should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided
  my\r\npremises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the\r\nother
  by myself.  According to my humor I threw open these doors, or\r\nclosed them.  I
  resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the\r\nfolding-doors, but on my side of
  them, so as to have this quiet man\r\nwithin easy call, in case any trifling thing
  was to be done.  I placed\r\nhis desk close up to a small side-window in that part
  of the room, a\r\nwindow which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain
  grimy\r\nback-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections,\r\ncommanded
  at present no view at all, though it gave some light.  Within\r\nthree feet of the
  panes was a wall, and the light came down from far\r\nabove, between two lofty buildings,
  as from a very small opening in a\r\ndome.  Still further to a satisfactory arrangement,
  I procured a high\r\ngreen folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby
  from my\r\nsight, though not remove him from my voice.  And thus, in a manner,\r\nprivacy
  and society were conjoined.\r\n\r\nAt first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity
  of writing.  As if long\r\nfamishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself
  on my\r\ndocuments.  There was no pause for digestion.  He ran a day and night\r\nline,
  copying by sun-light and by candle-light.  I should have been\r\nquite delighted
  with his application, had he been cheerfully\r\nindustrious.  But he wrote on silently,
  palely, mechanically.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener's
  business to\r\nverify the accuracy of his copy, word by word.  Where there are two
  or\r\nmore scriveners in an office, they assist each other in this\r\nexamination,
  one reading from the copy, the other holding the original.\r\nIt is a very dull,
  wearisome, and lethargic affair.  I can readily\r\nimagine that to some sanguine
  temperaments it would be altogether\r\nintolerable.  For example, I cannot credit
  that the mettlesome poet\r\nByron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby
  to examine a law\r\ndocument of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy
  hand.\r\n\r\nNow and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist\r\nin
  comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for\r\nthis purpose.
  \ One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me\r\nbehind the screen, was
  to avail myself of his services on such trivial\r\noccasions.  It was on the third
  day, I think, of his being with me, and\r\nbefore any necessity had arisen for having
  his own writing examined,\r\nthat, being much hurried to complete a small affair
  I had in hand, I\r\nabruptly called to Bartleby.  In my haste and natural expectancy
  of\r\ninstant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my\r\ndesk,
  and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with\r\nthe copy, so
  that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Bartleby\r\nmight snatch it and
  proceed to business without the least delay.\r\n\r\nIn this very attitude did I
  sit when I called to him, rapidly stating\r\nwhat it was I wanted him to do--namely,
  to examine a small paper with\r\nme.  Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation,
  when without moving\r\nfrom his privacy, Bartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice,
  replied, \"I\r\nwould prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\nI sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying
  my stunned faculties.\r\nImmediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived
  me, or Bartleby\r\nhad entirely misunderstood my meaning.  I repeated my request
  in the\r\nclearest tone I could assume.  But in quite as clear a one came the\r\nprevious
  reply, \"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prefer not to,\" echoed I, rising in
  high excitement, and crossing the\r\nroom with a stride.  \"What do you mean?  Are
  you moon-struck?  I want\r\nyou to help me compare this sheet here--take it,\" and
  I thrust it\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to,\" said he.\r\n\r\nI
  looked at him steadfastly.  His face was leanly composed; his gray eye\r\ndimly
  calm.  Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him.  Had there been the\r\nleast uneasiness,
  anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in\r\nother words, had there been
  any thing ordinarily human about him,\r\ndoubtless I should have violently dismissed
  him from the premises.  But\r\nas it was, I should have as soon thought of turning
  my pale\r\nplaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors.  I stood gazing at him\r\nawhile,
  as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at\r\nmy desk.  This
  is very strange, thought I.  What had one best do?  But\r\nmy business hurried me.
  \ I concluded to forget the matter for the\r\npresent, reserving it for my future
  leisure.  So calling Nippers from\r\nthe other room, the paper was speedily examined.\r\n\r\nA
  few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being\r\nquadruplicates
  of a week's testimony taken before me in my High Court of\r\nChancery.  It became
  necessary to examine them.  It was an important\r\nsuit, and great accuracy was
  imperative.  Having all things arranged I\r\ncalled Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut
  from the next room, meaning to\r\nplace the four copies in the hands of my four
  clerks, while I should\r\nread from the original.  Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and
  Ginger Nut had\r\ntaken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when
  I\r\ncalled to Bartleby to join this interesting group.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby!  quick,
  I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\nI heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted
  floor, and\r\nsoon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.\r\n\r\n\"What
  is wanted?\" said he mildly.\r\n\r\n\"The copies, the copies,\" said I hurriedly.
  \ \"We are going to examine\r\nthem.  There\"--and I held towards him the fourth
  quadruplicate.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to,\" he said, and gently disappeared
  behind the\r\nscreen.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt,
  standing at the\r\nhead of my seated column of clerks.  Recovering myself, I advanced\r\ntowards
  the screen, and demanded the reason for such extraordinary\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\"_Why_
  do you refuse?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\nWith any other man I should
  have flown outright into a dreadful passion,\r\nscorned all further words, and thrust
  him ignominiously from my\r\npresence.  But there was something about Bartleby that
  not only\r\nstrangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and\r\ndisconcerted
  me.  I began to reason with him.\r\n\r\n\"These are your own copies we are about
  to examine.  It is labor saving\r\nto you, because one examination will answer for
  your four papers.  It is\r\ncommon usage.  Every copyist is bound to help examine
  his copy.  Is it\r\nnot so?  Will you not speak?  Answer!\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer not
  to,\" he replied in a flute-like tone.  It seemed to me\r\nthat while I had been
  addressing him, he carefully revolved every\r\nstatement that I made; fully comprehended
  the meaning; could not gainsay\r\nthe irresistible conclusions; but, at the same
  time, some paramount\r\nconsideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.\r\n\r\n\"You
  are decided, then, not to comply with my request--a request made\r\naccording to
  common usage and common sense?\"\r\n\r\nHe briefly gave me to understand that on
  that point my judgment was\r\nsound.  Yes:  his decision was irreversible.\r\n\r\nIt
  is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some\r\nunprecedented and
  violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in\r\nhis own plainest faith.  He
  begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that,\r\nwonderful as it may be, all the
  justice and all the reason is on the\r\nother side.  Accordingly, if any disinterested
  persons are present, he\r\nturns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering
  mind.\r\n\r\n\"Turkey,\" said I, \"what do you think of this?  Am I not right?\"\r\n\r\n\"With
  submission, sir,\" said Turkey, with his blandest tone, \"I think\r\nthat you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nippers,\"
  said I, \"what do _you_ think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I should kick him out of
  the office.\"\r\n\r\n(The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it
  being\r\nmorning, Turkey's answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but\r\nNippers
  replies in ill-tempered ones.  Or, to repeat a previous\r\nsentence, Nippers' ugly
  mood was on duty and Turkey's off.)\r\n\r\n\"Ginger Nut,\" said I, willing to enlist
  the smallest suffrage in my\r\nbehalf, \"what do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,
  sir, he's a little _luny_,\" replied Ginger Nut with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"You hear what
  they say,\" said I, turning towards the screen, \"come\r\nforth and do your duty.\"\r\n\r\nBut
  he vouchsafed no reply.  I pondered a moment in sore perplexity.\r\nBut once more
  business hurried me.  I determined again to postpone the\r\nconsideration of this
  dilemma to my future leisure.  With a little\r\ntrouble we made out to examine the
  papers without Bartleby, though at\r\nevery page or two, Turkey deferentially dropped
  his opinion that this\r\nproceeding was quite out of the common; while Nippers,
  twitching in his\r\nchair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set
  teeth\r\noccasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the\r\nscreen.
  \ And for his (Nippers') part, this was the first and the last\r\ntime he would
  do another man's business without pay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage,
  oblivious to every thing but\r\nhis own peculiar business there.\r\n\r\nSome days
  passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy\r\nwork.  His late remarkable
  conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly.\r\nI observed that he never went to
  dinner; indeed that he never went any\r\nwhere.  As yet I had never of my personal
  knowledge known him to be\r\noutside of my office.  He was a perpetual sentry in
  the corner.  At\r\nabout eleven o'clock though, in the morning, I noticed that Ginger
  Nut\r\nwould advance toward the opening in Bartleby's screen, as if silently\r\nbeckoned
  thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat.  The boy\r\nwould then leave the
  office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a\r\nhandful of ginger-nuts which
  he delivered in the hermitage, receiving\r\ntwo of the cakes for his trouble.\r\n\r\nHe
  lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly\r\nspeaking;
  he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats even\r\nvegetables, he eats
  nothing but ginger-nuts.  My mind then ran on in\r\nreveries concerning the probable
  effects upon the human constitution of\r\nliving entirely on ginger-nuts.  Ginger-nuts
  are so called because they\r\ncontain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents,
  and the final\r\nflavoring one.  Now what was ginger?  A hot, spicy thing.  Was
  Bartleby\r\nhot and spicy?  Not at all.  Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby.\r\nProbably
  he preferred it should have none.\r\n\r\nNothing so aggravates an earnest person
  as a passive resistance.  If the\r\nindividual so resisted be of a not inhumane
  temper, and the resisting\r\none perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the
  better moods of\r\nthe former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination\r\nwhat
  proves impossible to be solved by his judgment.  Even so, for the\r\nmost part,
  I regarded Bartleby and his ways.  Poor fellow! thought I, he\r\nmeans no mischief;
  it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect\r\nsufficiently evinces that his
  eccentricities are involuntary.  He is\r\nuseful to me.  I can get along with him.
  \ If I turn him away, the\r\nchances are he will fall in with some less indulgent
  employer, and then\r\nhe will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably
  to starve.\r\nYes.  Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval.  To\r\nbefriend
  Bartleby; to humor him in his strange willfulness, will cost me\r\nlittle or nothing,
  while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove\r\na sweet morsel for my conscience.
  \ But this mood was not invariable with\r\nme.  The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes
  irritated me.  I felt\r\nstrangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition,
  to elicit some\r\nangry spark from him answerable to my own.  But indeed I might
  as well\r\nhave essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor\r\nsoap.
  \ But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the\r\nfollowing little
  scene ensued:\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, \"when those papers are all copied, I
  will compare\r\nthem with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?
  \ Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nI
  threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and\r\nNippers, exclaimed
  in an excited manner--\r\n\r\n\"He says, a second time, he won't examine his papers.
  \ What do you think\r\nof it, Turkey?\"\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered.
  \ Turkey sat glowing like a brass\r\nboiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling
  among his blotted\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\"Think of it?\" roared Turkey; \"I think I'll
  just step behind his screen,\r\nand black his eyes for him!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying,
  Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic\r\nposition.  He was
  hurrying away to make good his promise, when I\r\ndetained him, alarmed at the effect
  of incautiously rousing Turkey's\r\ncombativeness after dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,
  Turkey,\" said I, \"and hear what Nippers has to say.  What do\r\nyou think of it,
  Nippers?  Would I not be justified in immediately\r\ndismissing Bartleby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse
  me, that is for you to decide, sir.  I think his conduct quite\r\nunusual, and indeed
  unjust, as regards Turkey and myself.  But it may\r\nonly be a passing whim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\"
  exclaimed I, \"you have strangely changed your mind then--you speak\r\nvery gently
  of him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"All beer,\" cried Turkey; \"gentleness is effects of beer--Nippers
  and I\r\ndined together to-day.  You see how gentle _I_ am, sir.  Shall I go and\r\nblack
  his eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"You refer to Bartleby, I suppose.  No, not to-day, Turkey,\"
  I replied;\r\n\"pray, put up your fists.\"\r\n\r\nI closed the doors, and again
  advanced towards Bartleby.  I felt\r\nadditional incentives tempting me to my fate.
  \ I burned to be rebelled\r\nagainst again.  I remembered that Bartleby never left
  the office.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, \"Ginger Nut is away; just step round to
  the Post\r\nOffice, won't you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there
  is\r\nany thing for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _will_
  not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I _prefer_ not.\"\r\n\r\nI staggered to my desk, and sat there in
  a deep study.  My blind\r\ninveteracy returned.  Was there any other thing in which
  I could procure\r\nmyself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?--my\r\nhired
  clerk?  What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he\r\nwill be sure
  to refuse to do?\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" in
  a louder tone.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" I roared.\r\n\r\nLike a very
  ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the\r\nthird summons, he
  appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.\r\n\r\n\"Go to the next room, and tell
  Nippers to come to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer not to,\" he respectfully and slowly
  said, and mildly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Bartleby,\" said I, in a quiet
  sort of serenely severe\r\nself-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose
  of some terrible\r\nretribution very close at hand.  At the moment I half intended
  something\r\nof the kind.  But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my\r\ndinner-hour,
  I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the\r\nday, suffering much
  from perplexity and distress of mind.\r\n\r\nShall I acknowledge it?  The conclusion
  of this whole business was, that\r\nit soon became a fixed fact of my chambers,
  that a pale young scrivener,\r\nby the name of Bartleby, had a desk there; that
  he copied for me at the\r\nusual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words);
  but he was\r\npermanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty
  being\r\ntransferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment doubtless to their\r\nsuperior
  acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was never on any account to\r\nbe dispatched
  on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if\r\nentreated to take upon
  him such a matter, it was generally understood\r\nthat he would prefer not to--in
  other words, that he would refuse\r\npointblank.\r\n\r\nAs days passed on, I became
  considerably reconciled to Bartleby.  His\r\nsteadiness, his freedom from all dissipation,
  his incessant industry\r\n(except when he chose to throw himself into a standing
  revery behind his\r\nscreen), his great, stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor
  under all\r\ncircumstances, made him a valuable acquisition.  One prime thing was\r\nthis,--_he
  was always there;_--first in the morning, continually\r\nthrough the day, and the
  last at night.  I had a singular confidence in\r\nhis honesty.  I felt my most precious
  papers perfectly safe in his\r\nhands.  Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the
  very soul of me, avoid\r\nfalling into sudden spasmodic passions with him.  For
  it was exceeding\r\ndifficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities,\r\nprivileges,
  and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit stipulations on\r\nBartleby's part
  under which he remained in my office.  Now and then, in\r\nthe eagerness of dispatching
  pressing business, I would inadvertently\r\nsummon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone,
  to put his finger, say, on the\r\nincipient tie of a bit of red tape with which
  I was about compressing\r\nsome papers.  Of course, from behind the screen the usual
  answer, \"I\r\nprefer not to,\" was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature\r\nwith
  the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly\r\nexclaiming upon such
  perverseness--such unreasonableness.  However,\r\nevery added repulse of this sort
  which I received only tended to lessen\r\nthe probability of my repeating the inadvertence.\r\n\r\nHere
  it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal\r\ngentlemen occupying
  chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there\r\nwere several keys to my door.
  \ One was kept by a woman residing in the\r\nattic, which person weekly scrubbed
  and daily swept and dusted my\r\napartments.  Another was kept by Turkey for convenience
  sake.  The third\r\nI sometimes carried in my own pocket.  The fourth I knew not
  who had.\r\n\r\nNow, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear
  a\r\ncelebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I\r\nthought
  I would walk around to my chambers for a while.  Luckily I had\r\nmy key with me;
  but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by\r\nsomething inserted from
  the inside.  Quite surprised, I called out; when\r\nto my consternation a key was
  turned from within; and thrusting his lean\r\nvisage at me, and holding the door
  ajar, the apparition of Bartleby\r\nappeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise
  in a strangely tattered\r\ndishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he
  was deeply engaged\r\njust then, and--preferred not admitting me at present.  In
  a brief word\r\nor two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round
  the\r\nblock two or three times, and by that time he would probably have\r\nconcluded
  his affairs.\r\n\r\nNow, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting
  my\r\nlaw-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly\r\n_nonchalance_,
  yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange\r\neffect upon me, that incontinently
  I slunk away from my own door, and\r\ndid as desired.  But not without sundry twinges
  of impotent rebellion\r\nagainst the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener.
  \ Indeed, it\r\nwas his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me,
  but\r\nunmanned me, as it were.  For I consider that one, for the time, is a\r\nsort
  of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate\r\nto him, and
  order him away from his own premises.  Furthermore, I was\r\nfull of uneasiness
  as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my\r\noffice in his shirt sleeves,
  and in an otherwise dismantled condition of\r\na Sunday morning.  Was any thing
  amiss going on?  Nay, that was out of\r\nthe question.  It was not to be thought
  of for a moment that Bartleby\r\nwas an immoral person.  But what could he be doing
  there?--copying?  Nay\r\nagain, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was
  an eminently\r\ndecorous person.  He would be the last man to sit down to his desk
  in\r\nany state approaching to nudity.  Besides, it was Sunday; and there was\r\nsomething
  about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that he would by\r\nany secular occupation
  violate the proprieties of the day.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, my mind was not pacified;
  and full of a restless\r\ncuriosity, at last I returned to the door.  Without hindrance
  I inserted\r\nmy key, opened it, and entered.  Bartleby was not to be seen.  I looked\r\nround
  anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he\r\nwas gone.
  \ Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an\r\nindefinite period
  Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my\r\noffice, and that too without
  plate, mirror, or bed.  The cushioned seat\r\nof a rickety old sofa in one corner
  bore the faint impress of a lean,\r\nreclining form.  Rolled away under his desk,
  I found a blanket; under\r\nthe empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair,
  a tin basin, with\r\nsoap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts
  and\r\na morsel of cheese.  Yes, thought I, it is evident enough that Bartleby\r\nhas
  been making his home here, keeping bachelor's hall all by himself.\r\nImmediately
  then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable\r\nfriendlessness and loneliness
  are here revealed!  His poverty is great;\r\nbut his solitude, how horrible!  Think
  of it.  Of a Sunday, Wall-street\r\nis deserted as Petra; and every night of every
  day it is an emptiness.\r\nThis building too, which of week-days hums with industry
  and life, at\r\nnightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn.\r\nAnd
  here Bartleby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude which he\r\nhas seen
  all populous--a sort of innocent and transformed Marius\r\nbrooding among the ruins
  of Carthage!\r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging\r\nmelancholy
  seized me.  Before, I had never experienced aught but a\r\nnot-unpleasing sadness.
  \ The bond of a common humanity now drew me\r\nirresistibly to gloom.  A fraternal
  melancholy!  For both I and Bartleby\r\nwere sons of Adam.  I remembered the bright
  silks and sparkling faces I\r\nhad seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing
  down the Mississippi\r\nof Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist,
  and thought\r\nto myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is
  gay;\r\nbut misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none.  These sad\r\nfancyings--chimeras,
  doubtless, of a sick and silly brain--led on to\r\nother and more special thoughts,
  concerning the eccentricities of\r\nBartleby.  Presentiments of strange discoveries
  hovered round me.  The\r\nscrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring
  strangers,\r\nin its shivering winding sheet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I was attracted by
  Bartleby's closed desk, the key in open\r\nsight left in the lock.\r\n\r\nI mean
  no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity,\r\nthought I; besides,
  the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will\r\nmake bold to look within.  Every
  thing was methodically arranged, the\r\npapers smoothly placed.  The pigeon holes
  were deep, and removing the\r\nfiles of documents, I groped into their recesses.
  \ Presently I felt\r\nsomething there, and dragged it out.  It was an old bandanna\r\nhandkerchief,
  heavy and knotted.  I opened it, and saw it was a savings'\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nI now
  recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man.  I\r\nremembered
  that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals\r\nhe had considerable
  time to himself, yet I had never seen him\r\nreading--no, not even a newspaper;
  that for long periods he would stand\r\nlooking out, at his pale window behind the
  screen, upon the dead brick\r\nwall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory
  or eating house;\r\nwhile his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer
  like\r\nTurkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any\r\nwhere
  in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk,\r\nunless indeed that
  was the case at present; that he had declined telling\r\nwho he was, or whence he
  came, or whether he had any relatives in the\r\nworld; that though so thin and pale,
  he never complained of ill health.\r\nAnd more than all, I remembered a certain
  unconscious air of pallid--how\r\nshall I call it?--of pallid haughtiness, say,
  or rather an austere\r\nreserve about him, which had positively awed me into my
  tame compliance\r\nwith his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the\r\nslightest
  incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his\r\nlong-continued motionlessness,
  that behind his screen he must be\r\nstanding in one of those dead-wall reveries
  of his.\r\n\r\nRevolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently\r\ndiscovered
  fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and\r\nhome, and not forgetful
  of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these\r\nthings, a prudential feeling began
  to steal over me.  My first emotions\r\nhad been those of pure melancholy and sincerest
  pity; but just in\r\nproportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to
  my\r\nimagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into\r\nrepulsion.
  \ So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain\r\npoint the thought
  or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but,\r\nin certain special cases,
  beyond that point it does not.  They err who\r\nwould assert that invariably this
  is owing to the inherent selfishness\r\nof the human heart.  It rather proceeds
  from a certain hopelessness of\r\nremedying excessive and organic ill.  To a sensitive
  being, pity is not\r\nseldom pain.  And when at last it is perceived that such pity
  cannot\r\nlead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it.  What
  I\r\nsaw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of\r\ninnate
  and incurable disorder.  I might give alms to his body; but his\r\nbody did not
  pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I\r\ncould not reach.\r\n\r\nI
  did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that\r\nmorning.  Somehow,
  the things I had seen disqualified me for the time\r\nfrom church-going.  I walked
  homeward, thinking what I would do with\r\nBartleby.  Finally, I resolved upon this;--I
  would put certain calm\r\nquestions to him the next morning, touching his history,
  etc., and if he\r\ndeclined to answer them openly and unreservedly (and I supposed
  he would\r\nprefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above\r\nwhatever
  I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer\r\nrequired; but that
  if in any other way I could assist him, I would be\r\nhappy to do so, especially
  if he desired to return to his native place,\r\nwherever that might be, I would
  willingly help to defray the expenses.\r\nMoreover, if, after reaching home, he
  found himself at any time in want\r\nof aid, a letter from him would be sure of
  a reply.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, gently calling
  to him behind his screen.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, in a still
  gentler tone, \"come here; I am not going\r\nto ask you to do any thing you would
  prefer not to do--I simply wish to\r\nspeak to you.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this he noiselessly
  slid into view.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?\"\r\n\r\n\"I
  would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me _any thing_ about yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I
  would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what reasonable objection can you have to speak
  to me?  I feel\r\nfriendly towards you.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not look at me while I spoke,
  but kept his glance fixed upon my\r\nbust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly
  behind me, some six\r\ninches above my head.\r\n\r\n\"What is your answer, Bartleby?\"
  said I, after waiting a considerable\r\ntime for a reply, during which his countenance
  remained immovable, only\r\nthere was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white
  attenuated mouth.\r\n\r\n\"At present I prefer to give no answer,\" he said, and
  retired into his\r\nhermitage.\r\n\r\nIt was rather weak in me I confess, but his
  manner on this occasion\r\nnettled me.  Not only did there seem to lurk in it a
  certain calm\r\ndisdain, but his perverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the\r\nundeniable
  good usage and indulgence he had received from me.\r\n\r\nAgain I sat ruminating
  what I should do.  Mortified as I was at his\r\nbehavior, and resolved as I had
  been to dismiss him when I entered my\r\noffices, nevertheless I strangely felt
  something superstitious knocking\r\nat my heart, and forbidding me to carry out
  my purpose, and denouncing\r\nme for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter
  word against this\r\nforlornest of mankind.  At last, familiarly drawing my chair
  behind his\r\nscreen, I sat down and said: \"Bartleby, never mind then about revealing\r\nyour
  history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as\r\nmay be with
  the usages of this office.  Say now you will help to examine\r\npapers to-morrow
  or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you\r\nwill begin to be a little
  reasonable:--say so, Bartleby.\"\r\n\r\n\"At present I would prefer not to be a
  little reasonable,\" was his\r\nmildly cadaverous reply.\r\n\r\nJust then the folding-doors
  opened, and Nippers approached.  He seemed\r\nsuffering from an unusually bad night's
  rest, induced by severer\r\nindigestion then common.  He overheard those final words
  of Bartleby.\r\n\r\n\"_Prefer not_, eh?\" gritted Nippers--\"I'd _prefer_ him, if
  I were you,\r\nsir,\" addressing me--\"I'd _prefer_ him; I'd give him preferences,
  the\r\nstubborn mule!  What is it, sir, pray, that he _prefers_ not to do now?\"\r\n\r\nBartleby
  moved not a limb.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Nippers,\" said I, \"I'd prefer that you would withdraw
  for the\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily
  using this word\r\n\"prefer\" upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions.
  \ And I\r\ntrembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and\r\nseriously
  affected me in a mental way.  And what further and deeper\r\naberration might it
  not yet produce?  This apprehension had not been\r\nwithout efficacy in determining
  me to summary means.\r\n\r\nAs Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing,
  Turkey blandly\r\nand deferentially approached.\r\n\r\n\"With submission, sir,\"
  said he, \"yesterday I was thinking about\r\nBartleby here, and I think that if
  he would but prefer to take a quart\r\nof good ale every day, it would do much towards
  mending him, and\r\nenabling him to assist in examining his papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"So
  you have got the word too,\" said I, slightly excited.\r\n\r\n\"With submission,
  what word, sir,\" asked Turkey, respectfully crowding\r\nhimself into the contracted
  space behind the screen, and by so doing,\r\nmaking me jostle the scrivener.  \"What
  word, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer to be left alone here,\" said Bartleby, as
  if offended at\r\nbeing mobbed in his privacy.\r\n\r\n\"_That's_ the word, Turkey,\"
  said I--\"that's it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _prefer_? oh yes--queer word.  I never use it
  myself.  But, sir, as\r\nI was saying, if he would but prefer--\"\r\n\r\n\"Turkey,\"
  interrupted I, \"you will please withdraw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh certainly, sir, if you
  prefer that I should.\"\r\n\r\nAs he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers
  at his desk caught a\r\nglimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have
  a certain paper\r\ncopied on blue paper or white.  He did not in the least roguishly
  accent\r\nthe word prefer.  It was plain that it involuntarily rolled form his\r\ntongue.
  \ I thought to myself, surely I must get rid of a demented man,\r\nwho already has
  in some degree turned the tongues, if not the heads of\r\nmyself and clerks.  But
  I thought it prudent not to break the dismission\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThe next day
  I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window\r\nin his dead-wall
  revery.  Upon asking him why he did not write, he said\r\nthat he had decided upon
  doing no more writing.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how now? what next?\" exclaimed I, \"do no
  more writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do
  you not see the reason for yourself,\" he indifferently replied.\r\n\r\nI looked
  steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and\r\nglazed.  Instantly
  it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in\r\ncopying by his dim window
  for the first few weeks of his stay with me\r\nmight have temporarily impaired his
  vision.\r\n\r\nI was touched.  I said something in condolence with him.  I hinted
  that\r\nof course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and\r\nurged
  him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in\r\nthe open air.
  \ This, however, he did not do.  A few days after this, my\r\nother clerks being
  absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch\r\ncertain letters by the mail, I
  thought that, having nothing else earthly\r\nto do, Bartleby would surely be less
  inflexible than usual, and carry\r\nthese letters to the post-office.  But he blankly
  declined.  So, much to\r\nmy inconvenience, I went myself.\r\n\r\nStill added days
  went by.  Whether Bartleby's eyes improved or not, I\r\ncould not say.  To all appearance,
  I thought they did.  But when I asked\r\nhim if they did, he vouchsafed no answer.
  \ At all events, he would do no\r\ncopying.  At last, in reply to my urgings, he
  informed me that he had\r\npermanently given up copying.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed
  I; \"suppose your eyes should get entirely well--better\r\nthan ever before--would
  you not copy then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given up copying,\" he answered, and slid aside.\r\n\r\nHe
  remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber.  Nay--if that were\r\npossible--he became
  still more of a fixture than before.  What was to be\r\ndone?  He would do nothing
  in the office: why should he stay there?  In\r\nplain fact, he had now become a
  millstone to me, not only useless as a\r\nnecklace, but afflictive to bear.  Yet
  I was sorry for him.  I speak\r\nless than truth when I say that, on his own account,
  he occasioned me\r\nuneasiness.  If he would but have named a single relative or
  friend, I\r\nwould instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow\r\naway
  to some convenient retreat.  But he seemed alone, absolutely alone\r\nin the universe.
  \ A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic.  At length,\r\nnecessities connected with
  my business tyrannized over all other\r\nconsiderations.  Decently as I could, I
  told Bartleby that in six days'\r\ntime he must unconditionally leave the office.
  \ I warned him to take\r\nmeasures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode.
  \ I offered to\r\nassist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the
  first step\r\ntowards a removal.  \"And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,\" added
  I,\r\n\"I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided.  Six days from\r\nthis
  hour, remember.\"\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen,
  and lo!\r\nBartleby was there.\r\n\r\nI buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced
  slowly towards him,\r\ntouched his shoulder, and said, \"The time has come; you
  must quit this\r\nplace; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I
  would prefer not,\" he replied, with his back still towards me.\r\n\r\n\"You _must_.\"\r\n\r\nHe
  remained silent.\r\n\r\nNow I had an unbounded confidence in this man's common honesty.
  \ He had\r\nfrequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped\r\nupon
  the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button\r\naffairs.  The
  proceeding then which followed will not be deemed\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\"
  said I, \"I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are\r\nthirty-two; the odd twenty
  are yours.--Will you take it?\" and I handed\r\nthe bills towards him.\r\n\r\nBut
  he made no motion.\r\n\r\n\"I will leave them here then,\" putting them under a
  weight on the table.\r\nThen taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly
  turned\r\nand added--\"After you have removed your things from these offices,\r\nBartleby,
  you will of course lock the door--since every one is now gone\r\nfor the day but
  you--and if you please, slip your key underneath the\r\nmat, so that I may have
  it in the morning.  I shall not see you again;\r\nso good-bye to you.  If hereafter
  in your new place of abode I can be of\r\nany service to you, do not fail to advise
  me by letter.  Good-bye,\r\nBartleby, and fare you well.\"\r\n\r\nBut he answered
  not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple,\r\nhe remained standing
  mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise\r\ndeserted room.\r\n\r\nAs I walked
  home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity.\r\nI could not but
  highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting\r\nrid of Bartleby.  Masterly
  I call it, and such it must appear to any\r\ndispassionate thinker.  The beauty
  of my procedure seemed to consist in\r\nits perfect quietness.  There was no vulgar
  bullying, no bravado of any\r\nsort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and
  fro across the\r\napartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle
  himself\r\noff with his beggarly traps.  Nothing of the kind.  Without loudly\r\nbidding
  Bartleby depart--as an inferior genius might have done--I\r\n_assumed_ the ground
  that depart he must; and upon that assumption built\r\nall I had to say.  The more
  I thought over my procedure, the more I was\r\ncharmed with it.  Nevertheless, next
  morning, upon awakening, I had my\r\ndoubts,--I had somehow slept off the fumes
  of vanity.  One of the\r\ncoolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes
  in the\r\nmorning.  My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever.--but only in theory.\r\nHow
  it would prove in practice--there was the rub.  It was truly a\r\nbeautiful thought
  to have assumed Bartleby's departure; but, after all,\r\nthat assumption was simply
  my own, and none of Bartleby's.  The great\r\npoint was, not whether I had assumed
  that he would quit me, but whether\r\nhe would prefer so to do.  He was more a man
  of preferences than\r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, I walked down town,
  arguing the probabilities _pro_ and\r\n_con_.  One moment I thought it would prove
  a miserable failure, and\r\nBartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual;
  the next moment\r\nit seemed certain that I should see his chair empty.  And so
  I kept\r\nveering about.  At the corner of Broadway and Canal-street, I saw quite\r\nan
  excited group of people standing in earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take odds
  he doesn't,\" said a voice as I passed.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't go?--done!\" said I, \"put
  up your money.\"\r\n\r\nI was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce
  my own, when\r\nI remembered that this was an election day.  The words I had overheard\r\nbore
  no reference to Bartleby, but to the success or non-success of some\r\ncandidate
  for the mayoralty.  In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it\r\nwere, imagined that
  all Broadway shared in my excitement, and were\r\ndebating the same question with
  me.  I passed on, very thankful that the\r\nuproar of the street screened my momentary
  absent-mindedness.\r\n\r\nAs I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office
  door.  I stood\r\nlistening for a moment.  All was still.  He must be gone.  I tried
  the\r\nknob.  The door was locked.  Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he\r\nindeed
  must be vanished.  Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I\r\nwas almost sorry
  for my brilliant success.  I was fumbling under the\r\ndoor mat for the key, which
  Bartleby was to have left there for me, when\r\naccidentally my knee knocked against
  a panel, producing a summoning\r\nsound, and in response a voice came to me from
  within--\"Not yet; I am\r\noccupied.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Bartleby.\r\n\r\nI was thunderstruck.
  \ For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in\r\nmouth, was killed one cloudless
  afternoon long ago in Virginia, by a\r\nsummer lightning; at his own warm open window
  he was killed, and\r\nremained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon, till
  some one\r\ntouched him, when he fell.\r\n\r\n\"Not gone!\" I murmured at last.
  \ But again obeying that wondrous\r\nascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener
  had over me, and from which\r\nascendancy, for all my chafing, I could not completely
  escape, I slowly\r\nwent down stairs and out into the street, and while walking
  round the\r\nblock, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity.\r\nTurn
  the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away\r\nby calling
  him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an\r\nunpleasant idea; and
  yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph\r\nover me,--this too I could not
  think of.  What was to be done? or, if\r\nnothing could be done, was there any thing
  further that I could _assume_\r\nin the matter?  Yes, as before I had prospectively
  assumed that Bartleby\r\nwould depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that
  departed he\r\nwas.  In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might
  enter\r\nmy office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see Bartleby at all,\r\nwalk
  straight against him as if he were air.  Such a proceeding would in\r\na singular
  degree have the appearance of a home-thrust.  It was hardly\r\npossible that Bartleby
  could withstand such an application of the\r\ndoctrine of assumptions.  But upon
  second thoughts the success of the\r\nplan seemed rather dubious.  I resolved to
  argue the matter over with\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, entering the
  office, with a quietly severe\r\nexpression, \"I am seriously displeased.  I am
  pained, Bartleby.  I had\r\nthought better of you.  I had imagined you of such a
  gentlemanly\r\norganization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would\r\nsuffice--in
  short, an assumption.  But it appears I am deceived.  Why,\"\r\nI added, unaffectedly
  starting, \"you have not even touched that money\r\nyet,\" pointing to it, just
  where I had left it the evening previous.\r\n\r\nHe answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Will
  you, or will you not, quit me?\" I now demanded in a sudden\r\npassion, advancing
  close to him.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer _not_ to quit you,\" he replied, gently emphasizing
  the\r\n_not_.\r\n\r\n\"What earthly right have you to stay here?  Do you pay any
  rent?  Do you\r\npay my taxes?  Or is this property yours?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered
  nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready to go on and write now?  Are your eyes recovered?
  \ Could\r\nyou copy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few lines?\r\nor
  step round to the post-office?  In a word, will you do any thing at\r\nall, to give
  a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises?\"\r\n\r\nHe silently retired
  into his hermitage.\r\n\r\nI was now in such a state of nervous resentment that
  I thought it but\r\nprudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations.\r\nBartleby
  and I were alone.  I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate\r\nAdams and the
  still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the\r\nlatter; and how poor
  Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and\r\nimprudently permitting himself
  to get wildly excited, was at unawares\r\nhurried into his fatal act--an act which
  certainly no man could possibly\r\ndeplore more than the actor himself.  Often it
  had occurred to me in my\r\nponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation
  taken place in\r\nthe public street, or at a private residence, it would not have\r\nterminated
  as it did.  It was the circumstance of being alone in a\r\nsolitary office, up stairs,
  of a building entirely unhallowed by\r\nhumanizing domestic associations--an uncarpeted
  office, doubtless, of a\r\ndusty, haggard sort of appearance;--this it must have
  been, which\r\ngreatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless
  Colt.\r\n\r\nBut when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me\r\nconcerning
  Bartleby, I grappled him and threw him.  How?  Why, simply by\r\nrecalling the divine
  injunction: \"A new commandment give I unto you,\r\nthat ye love one another.\"
  \ Yes, this it was that saved me.  Aside from\r\nhigher considerations, charity
  often operates as a vastly wise and\r\nprudent principle--a great safeguard to its
  possessor.  Men have\r\ncommitted murder for jealousy's sake, and anger's sake,
  and hatred's\r\nsake, and selfishness' sake, and spiritual pride's sake; but no
  man that\r\never I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity's\r\nsake.
  \ Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted,\r\nshould, especially
  with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity\r\nand philanthropy.  At any
  rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove\r\nto drown my exasperated feelings
  towards the scrivener by benevolently\r\nconstruing his conduct.  Poor fellow, poor
  fellow! thought I, he don't\r\nmean any thing; and besides, he has seen hard times,
  and ought to be\r\nindulged.\r\n\r\nI endeavored also immediately to occupy myself,
  and at the same time to\r\ncomfort my despondency.  I tried to fancy that in the
  course of the\r\nmorning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him.  Bartleby,
  of his\r\nown free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some\r\ndecided
  line of march in the direction of the door.  But no.  Half-past\r\ntwelve o'clock
  came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his\r\ninkstand, and become generally
  obstreperous; Nippers abated down into\r\nquietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched
  his noon apple; and Bartleby\r\nremained standing at his window in one of his profoundest
  dead-wall\r\nreveries.  Will it be credited?  Ought I to acknowledge it?  That\r\nafternoon
  I left the office without saying one further word to him.\r\n\r\nSome days now passed,
  during which, at leisure intervals I looked a\r\nlittle into \"Edwards on the Will,\"
  and \"Priestly on Necessity.\"  Under\r\nthe circumstances, those books induced
  a salutary feeling.  Gradually I\r\nslid into the persuasion that these troubles
  of mine touching the\r\nscrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and
  Bartleby was\r\nbilleted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence,\r\nwhich
  it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom.  Yes, Bartleby,\r\nstay there behind
  your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more;\r\nyou are harmless and noiseless
  as any of these old chairs; in short, I\r\nnever feel so private as when I know
  you are here.  At last I see it, I\r\nfeel it; I penetrate to the predestinated
  purpose of my life.  I am\r\ncontent.  Others may have loftier parts to enact; but
  my mission in this\r\nworld, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such
  period as\r\nyou may see fit to remain.\r\n\r\nI believe that this wise and blessed
  frame of mind would have continued\r\nwith me, had it not been for the unsolicited
  and uncharitable remarks\r\nobtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited
  the rooms.  But\r\nthus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds
  wears\r\nout at last the best resolves of the more generous.  Though to be sure,\r\nwhen
  I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my\r\noffice should
  be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable\r\nBartleby, and so be tempted
  to throw out some sinister observations\r\nconcerning him.  Sometimes an attorney
  having business with me, and\r\ncalling at my office and finding no one but the
  scrivener there, would\r\nundertake to obtain some sort of precise information from
  him touching\r\nmy whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would
  remain\r\nstanding immovable in the middle of the room.  So after contemplating\r\nhim
  in that position for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser\r\nthan he came.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and\r\nwitnesses and
  business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal\r\ngentleman present, seeing
  Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him\r\nto run round to his (the legal
  gentleman's) office and fetch some papers\r\nfor him.  Thereupon, Bartleby would
  tranquilly decline, and yet remain\r\nidle as before.  Then the lawyer would give
  a great stare, and turn to\r\nme.  And what could I say?  At last I was made aware
  that all through\r\nthe circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder
  was\r\nrunning round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at my\r\noffice.
  \ This worried me very much.  And as the idea came upon me of his\r\npossibly turning
  out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers,\r\nand denying my authority;
  and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing\r\nmy professional reputation; and
  casting a general gloom over the\r\npremises; keeping soul and body together to
  the last upon his savings\r\n(for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and
  in the end perhaps\r\noutlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of
  his perpetual\r\noccupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more
  and\r\nmore, and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon\r\nthe
  apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in me.  I resolved\r\nto gather
  all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this\r\nintolerable incubus.\r\n\r\nEre
  revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I\r\nfirst simply
  suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent\r\ndeparture.  In a calm and
  serious tone, I commended the idea to his\r\ncareful and mature consideration.  But
  having taken three days to\r\nmeditate upon it, he apprised me that his original
  determination\r\nremained"
