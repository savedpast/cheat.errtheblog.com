xargs: ! "xargs allows construction of UNIX shell command lines at a higher level
  of abstraction.  This makes it harder to grasp, as well as more flexible (and therefore
  powerful).  Examples are the best way to get a grip on what it can do.\n\nLet's
  suppose you have a list of files you want to edit, stored in current_files.txt.
  \ You can pass them all to your favorite text editor like so:\n$ xargs mate  < current_files.txt\n\nOr
  if you prefer vim or emacs, it's just the same:\n$ xargs vim   < current_files.txt\n$
  xargs emacs < current_files.txt\n\nThese read, more or less, as \n  \"pass a bunch
  of arguments to my editor, which are read from current_files.txt\".\n\nSo if current_files.txt
  contains the following files\n   app/controllers/application.rb\n   app/models/article.rb\nthen
  xargs would, in effect, call this command:\n$ mate app/controllers/application.rb
  app/models/article.rb\n\nEven though UNIX commands have limits to the number of
  arguments they can take, you don't have to worry about the list of files being too
  long, since xargs takes care of that.  If you had a list of 1000 files, xargs would
  break it into chunks small enough for the command to handle.  (In the case of TextMate,
  this would probably result in opening separate project windows.  Feel free to test
  that and update this cheatsheet.)\n\n\nYou don't need to read the arguments from
  a file, though.  You can also pipe them from another command to xargs, like so:\n$
  ls *test* | xargs mate\n\nOf course, this isn't very useful, because you could just
  as easily have typed \n$ mate *test*\nbut it does illustrate a very simple case
  of piping commands to xargs, and how it works.  \n\nHere's a slightly more useful
  example:\n$ find . -name '*test*' | xargs mate\n\nAssuming you're in the root of
  a Ruby on Rails application, this will open (in TextMate) all of the files and folders
  with 'test' in their names.  Notice that you pipe from the find command to xargs,
  and then mate is an argument of xargs.  You might think that you could pipe directly
  to mate, but that doesn't work.  (Try it to see what happens.)  \n\nNow that you've
  got the basics down, all the examples you find by googling \"xargs examples\" will
  make a lot more sense.  Please add the ones here that you find expecially useful.\n\nHere
  are few places where I've found useful examples:\n     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs\n
  \    http://www.softpanorama.org/Tools/xargs.shtml\n\nIf you want to execute one
  command per line, use the -n <num arguments> parameter:\n\n$ find . -name '*test*'
  | xargs -n1 mate\n\n#BZ#"
