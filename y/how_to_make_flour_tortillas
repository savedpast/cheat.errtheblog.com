how_to_make_flour_tortillas: ! "Texas Flour Tortillas (adapted from The Border Cookbook
  by Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison)\r\nIngredients:\r\nTwo cups of all-purpose
  flour (can make them whole wheat by substituting one cup of whole-wheat flour for
  white flour)\r\n1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder\r\n1 teaspoon of salt\r\n2 teaspoons
  of vegetable oil\r\n3/4 cups of warm milk\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\nMix together the flour,
  baking powder, salt and oil.\r\nSlowly add the warm milk.\r\nStir until a loose,
  sticky ball is formed.\r\nKnead for two minutes on a floured surface. Dough should
  be firm and soft.\r\nPlace dough in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth or plastic
  wrap for 20 minutes.\r\nAfter the dough has rested, break off eight sections, roll
  them into balls in your hands, place on a plate (make sure they aren’t touching)
  and then cover balls with damp cloth or plastic wrap for 10 minutes. (It’s very
  important to let the dough rest, otherwise it will be like elastic and won’t roll
  out to a proper thickness and shape.)\r\nAfter dough has rested, one at a time place
  a dough ball on a floured surface, pat it out into a four-inch circle, and then
  roll with a rolling pin from the center until it’s thin and about eight inches in
  diameter. (If you roll out pie crusts you’ll have no problem with this.) Don’t over
  work the dough, or it’ll be stiff. Keep rolled-out tortillas covered until ready
  to cook.\r\nIn a dry iron skillet or comal heated on high, cook the tortilla about
  thirty seconds on each side. It should start to puff a bit when it’s done.\r\nKeep
  cooked tortillas covered wrapped in a napkin until ready to eat.\r\nCan be reheated
  in a dry iron skillet, over your gas-burner flame or in the oven wrapped in foil.\r\nWhile
  you probably won’t have any leftovers, you can store in the fridge tightly wrapped
  in foil or plastic for a day or so.\r\nMakes eight tortillas."
