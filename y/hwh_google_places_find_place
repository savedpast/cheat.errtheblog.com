hwh_google_places_find_place: ! "In Order to retrieve information about a specific
  place you must first do a Place search to retrieve a reference key which can then
  be passed to the Place Details Search.\r\n\r\nPLACE SEARCHES\r\n\r\nPlace Search
  Requests\r\n\r\nA Place search request must be in the following form\r\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/search/output?parameters\r\n\r\nOutput
  can be either of the following values:\r\njson - (recommended) indicates output
  in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\r\nxml  - indicates output as XML\r\n\r\nCertain
  parameters are required to initiate a Place Search request. As is standard in URLs,
  all parameters are separated using the ampersand (&) character. The list of parameters
  and their possible values are enumerated below.\r\n\r\n1.) key (required) — Your
  application's API key. This key identifies your application for purposes of quota
  management and so that Places added from your application are made immediately available
  to your app. Visit the APIs Console to create an API Project and obtain your key.\r\n\r\n2.)
  location (required) — The latitude/longitude around which to retrieve Place information.
  This must be specified as latitude,longitude.\r\n\r\n3.) radius (required) — The
  distance (in meters) within which to return Place results. The maximum allowed radius
  is 50 000 meters.\r\n\r\n4.) sensor (required) — Indicates whether or not the Place
  request came from a device using a location sensor (e.g. a GPS) to determine the
  location sent in this request. This value must be either true or false.\r\n\r\n5.)
  keyword (optional) — A term to be matched against all available fields, including
  but not limited to name, type, and address, as well as customer reviews and other
  third-party content.\r\n\r\n6.) language (optional) — The language code, indicating
  in which language the results should be returned, if possible. See the list of supported
  languages and their codes. Note that we often update supported languages so this
  list may not be exhaustive.\r\n\r\n7.) name (optional) — A term to be matched against
  the names of Places. Results will be restricted to those containing the passed name
  value.\r\n\r\n8.) types (optional) — Restricts the results to Places matching at
  least one of the specified types. Types should be separated with a pipe symbol (type1|type2|etc).
  \r\n\r\n\r\nAn example request is below, showing a search for Places of type 'food'
  within a 500m radius of a point in Sydney, Australia, containing the word 'harbour'
  in their name:\r\n\r\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/search/json?location=-33.8670522,151.1957362&radius=500&types=food&name=harbour&sensor=false&key=AddYourOwnKeyHere\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACE

  JSON response contains three root elements:\r\n\r\n1.) \"status\" contains metadata
  on the request. See Status Codes below.\r\n\r\n2.) \"results\" contains an array
  of Places, with information about each. See Place Search Results for information
  about these results. The Places API returns up to 20 establishment results. Additionally,
  political results may be returned which serve to identify the area of the request.\r\n\r\n3.)
  html_attributions contain a set of attributions about this listing which must be
  displayed to the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus Codes\r\n\r\nThe \"status\" field within
  the Place Search response object contains the status of the request, and may contain
  debugging information to help you track down why the Place Search request failed.
  The \"status\" field may contain the following values:\r\n\r\nOK indicates that
  no errors occurred; the place was successfully detected and at least one result
  was returned.\r\n\r\nZERO_RESULTS indicates that the search was successful but returned
  no results. This may occur if the search was passed a latlng in a remote location.\r\n\r\nOVER_QUERY_LIMIT
  indicates that you are over your quota.\r\n\r\nREQUEST_DENIED indicates that your
  request was denied, generally because of lack of a sensor parameter.\r\n\r\nINVALID_REQUEST
  generally indicates that a required query parameter (location or radius) is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace
  Search Results\r\n\r\nWhen the Places service returns JSON results from a search,
  it places them within a results array. Even if the service returns no results (such
  as if the location is remote) it still returns an empty results array. XML responses
  consist of zero or more <result> elements.\r\n\r\nEach element of the results array
  contains a single result from the specified area (location and radius), ordered
  by prominence. The ordering of results can be influenced by check-in activity within
  your application - Places with many recent check-ins may figure more prominently
  in your application's results. The result may also contain attribution information
  which must be displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nEach result within the results array
  may contain the following fields:\r\n\r\nicon contains the URL of a recommended
  icon which may be displayed to the user when indicating this result.\r\n\r\nid contains
  a unique stable identifier denoting this place. This identifier may not be used
  to retrieve information about this place, but is guaranteed to be valid across sessions.
  It can be used to consolidate data about this Place, and to verify the identity
  of a Place across separate searches.\r\n\r\ngeometry contains geometry information
  about the result, generally including the \r\n\r\nlocation (geocode) of the Place
  and (optionally) the viewport identifying its general area of coverage.\r\n\r\nname
  contains the human-readable name for the returned result. For establishment results,
  this is usually the business name.\r\n\r\nrating contains the Place's rating, from
  0.0 to 5.0, based on user reviews.\r\n\r\nreference contains a unique token that
  you can use to retrieve additional information about this place in a Place Details
  request. You can store this token and use it at any time in future to refresh cached
  data about this Place, but the same token is not guaranteed to be returned for any
  given Place across different searches.\r\n\r\ntypes[] contains an array of feature
  types describing the given result. See the list of supported types at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/supported_types
  for more information. XML responses include multiple <type> elements if more than
  one type is assigned to the result.\r\n\r\nvicinity contains a feature name of a
  nearby location. Often this feature refers to a street or neighborhood within the
  given results.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace Details\r\n\r\nOnce you have a reference from a
  Place Search request, you can request more details about a particular establishment
  or point of interest by initiating a Place Details request. A Place Details request
  returns more comprehensive information about the indicated place such as its complete
  address, phone number, user rating, etc.\r\n\r\nPlace Details Requests\r\n\r\nA
  Place Details request is an HTTP URL of the following form:\r\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/output?parameters\r\n\r\nwhere
  output may be either of the following values:\r\n\r\njson (recommended) indicates
  output in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\r\n\r\nxml indicates output as XML\r\n\r\nCertain
  parameters are required to initiate a search request. As is standard in URLs, all
  parameters are separated using the ampersand (&) character. The list of parameters
  and their possible values are enumerated below.\r\n\r\nkey (required) — Your application's
  API key. This key identifies your application for purposes of quota management and
  so that Places added from your application are made immediately available to your
  app. Visit the APIs Console to create an API Project and obtain your key.\r\n\r\nreference
  (required) — A textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place, returned from
  a Place search request.\r\n\r\nsensor (required) — Indicates whether or not the
  Place Details request came from a device using a location sensor (e.g. a GPS). This
  value must be either true or false.\r\n\r\nlanguage (optional) — The language code,
  indicating in which language the results should be returned, if possible. See the
  list of supported languages and their codes. Note that we often update supported
  languages so this list may not be exhaustive.\r\n\r\nAn example request is shown
  below:\r\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?reference=CmRYAAAAciqGsTRX1mXRvuXSH2ErwW-jCINE1aLiwP64MCWDN5vkXvXoQGPKldMfmdGyqWSpm7BEYCgDm-iv7Kc2PF7QA7brMAwBbAcqMr5i1f4PwTpaovIZjysCEZTry8Ez30wpEhCNCXpynextCld2EBsDkRKsGhSLayuRyFsex6JA6NPh9dyupoTH3g&sensor=true&key=AddYourOwnKeyHere\r\n\r\nPlace

  \ },\r\n  \"status\" : \"OK\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nA JSON response contains three root elements:\r\n\r\n1.)
  \"status\" contains metadata on the request. See Status Codes below.\r\n\r\n2.)
  \"result\" contains the detailed information about the place requested. See Place
  Details Results for information about these results.\r\n\r\n3.) html_attributions
  contain a set of attributions about this listing which must be displayed to the
  user.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace Details Results\r\n\r\nWhen the Places service returns results
  from a details request, it places them within a single result. Each result may contain
  the following fields:\r\n\r\naddress_components[] is an array of separate address
  components used to compose a given address. For example, the address \"111 8th Avenue,
  New York, NY\" contains separate address components for \"111\" (the street number,
  \"8th Avenue\" (the route), \"New York\" (the city) and \"NY\" (the US state). Each
  address_component typically contains:\r\n\r\ntypes[] is an array indicating the
  type of the address component.\r\nlong_name is the full text description or name
  of the address component as returned by the Geocoder.\r\n\r\nshort_name is an abbreviated
  textual name for the address component, if available. For example, an address component
  for the state of Alaska may have a long_name of \"Alaska\" and a short_name of \"AK\"
  using the 2-letter postal abbreviation.\r\n\r\nformatted_address is a string containing
  the human-readable address of this place. Often this address is equivalent to the
  \"postal address,\" which sometimes differs from country to country. (Note that
  some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not allow distribution of complete
  postal addresses due to licensing restrictions.) This address is generally composed
  of one or more address components. For example, the address \"111 8th Avenue, New
  York, NY\" contains separate address components for \"111\" (the street number,
  \"8th Avenue\" (the route), \"New York\" (the city) and \"NY\" (the US state). These
  address components contain additional information as noted below.\r\n\r\nformatted_phone_number
  contains the Place's phone number in its local format. For example, the formatted_phone_number
  for Google's Sydney, Australia office is (02) 9374 4000.\r\n\r\ngeometry contains
  the following information:\r\n\r\nlocation contains the geocoded latitude,longitude
  value for this place.\r\n\r\nicon contains the URL of a suggested icon which may
  be displayed to the user when indicating this result on a map\r\n\r\nid contains
  a unique stable identifier denoting this place. This identifier may not be used
  to retrieve information about this place, but can be used to consolidate data about
  this Place, and to verify the identity of a Place across separate searches. As ids
  can occasionally change, it's recommended that the stored id for a Place be compared
  with the id returned in later Details requests for the same Place, and updated if
  necessary.\r\n\r\ninternational_phone_number contains the Place's phone number in
  international format. International format includes the country code, and is prefixed
  with the plus (+) sign. For example, the formatted_phone_number for Google's Sydney,
  Australia office is +61 2 9374 4000.\r\n\r\nname contains the human-readable name
  for the returned result. For establishment results, this is usually the canonicalized
  business name.\r\n\r\nrating contains the Place's rating, from 0.0 to 5.0, based
  on user reviews.\r\n\r\nreference contains a token that can be used to query the
  Details service in future. This token may differ from the reference used in the
  request to the Details service. It is recommended that stored references for Places
  be regularly updated. Although this token uniquely identifies the Place, the converse
  is not true: a Place may have many valid reference tokens.\r\n\r\ntypes[] contains
  an array of feature types describing the given result. See the list of supported
  types for more information. XML responses include multiple <type> elements if more
  than one type is assigned to the result.\r\n\r\nurl contains the official Google
  Place Page URL of this establishment. Applications must link to or embed the Google
  Place page on any screen that shows detailed results about this Place to the user.\r\n\r\nvicinity
  lists a simplified address for the Place, including the street name, street number,
  and locality, but not the province/state, postal code, or country. For example,
  Google's Sydney, Australia office has a vicinity value of 5/48 Pirrama Road, Pyrmont.\r\nwebsite
  lists the authoritative website for this Place, such as a business' homepage."
