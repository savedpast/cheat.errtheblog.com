blender: ! "No control buttons\n - everything is done directly with the keyboard keys\n\nAdding
  a new object\n - Space Bar\n\nMark all objects\n - A\n\nDelete all currently marked
  objects\n - X\n\nScale all objects\n - N\n - <Tab>\n - <Tab>... until in the object
  properties window\n   the scale appears\n\nBlender Units are all millimeter -->
  12.123 --> 12 mm --> 1.2 cms\n\nRemove duplicate vertices - important for gcode
  generation\n\n1. Hit Tab to enter Mesh Edit mode\n2. Hit A to select all nodes (everything
  goes yellow and purple)\n3. Type W6 or select Mesh -> Vertices -> Remove Doubles\n\n\nA
  few UI tips:\n\n - the 'A' key toggles between select all and select none\n - the
  right key is how you select objects\n - the tab key will take you between object
  and mesh mode\n - holding middle click will allow you to move your view. scrolling
  it will zoom.\n - the num pad keys will give you good default views if you get lost\n
  - the 'X' key will allow you to delete objects, like the default cube when you open
  blender\n\nFind non-manifold points\n\nNon-manifold points are points that just
  don't make sense in the real world. These can be hanging points, internal surfaces,
  holes, zero-thickness walls, etc. Unfortunately there is no way to automatically
  fix them in software. The best you can do is to identify the problems and then attempt
  to fix them.\n\n1. Hit Tab to enter Mesh Edit mode\n2. Hit A to deselect all nodes
  (everything goes gray and pink)\n3. Select Select -> Non-Manifold\n\nIf there are
  non-manifold points, they will be selected. If nothing happens, you're golden. \nIf
  there are problems, then you can see what's wrong and attempt to fix it.\n\nImporting
  SVGs\n\n - import and then\n - Alt-C converts them to mesh that can be extruded
  and worked on\n\nExtrude (create a new point)\n - E (z,y,x to lock to one coordinate)\n\nGoto
  (move existing point)\n - G (z,y,x to lock to one coordinate)\n\nCreate a face between
  points\n - Select the two points (right mouse button and shift-RMB)\n - F\n - shift-F
  to create face using triangles\n\nConverting Fonts to Meshes\n - Having entered
  the text, switch to object mode\n - (Edit mode is used to enter text)\n - Add a
  new object\n - Select the old text object\n - Alt-C\n - Text is no mesh!\n\nMove
  cursor to the origin\n - Shift-C in edit mode (and object mode?)\n\nJoin / Combine
  meshes\n - Object Mode --> J\n - Edit Mode --> P\n\nTutorials\n - http://www.rab3d.com/rab3d/tutorial/608/tutorial_608-1.html"
