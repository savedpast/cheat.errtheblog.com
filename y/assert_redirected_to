assert_redirected_to: ! "# 'cheat assertions' for the rest\n\nassert_redirected_to(options
  = {}, message=nil)\n\nAssert that the redirection options passed in match those
  of the redirect called in the latest action. This match can be partial, such that
  assert_redirected_to(:controller => \"weblog\") will also match the redirection
  of redirect_to(:controller => \"weblog\", :action => \"show\") and so on.\n\nExamples\n\n
  \ # assert that the redirection was to the \"index\" action on the WeblogController\n
  \ assert_redirected_to :controller => \"weblog\", :action => \"index\"\n\n  # assert
  that the redirection was to the named route login_url\n  assert_redirected_to login_url"
