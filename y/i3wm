  a short overview of the default keybindings:\r\n\r\n       j/k/l/;\r\n           Direction
  keys (left, down, up, right). They are on your homerow\r\n           (see the mark
  on your \"j\" key). Alternatively, you can use the\r\n           cursor keys.\r\n\r\n
  \      Mod1+<direction>\r\n           Focus window in <direction>.\r\n\r\n       Mod3+<direction>\r\n
  \          Focus container in <direction>.\r\n\r\n       Mod1+Shift+<direction>\r\n
  \          Move window to <direction>.\r\n\r\n       Mod3+Shift+<direction>\r\n
  \          Move container to <direction>.\r\n\r\n       Mod1+Control+<direction>\r\n
  \          Snap container to <direction>.\r\n\r\n       Mod1+<number>\r\n           Switch
  to workspace <number>.\r\n\r\n       Mod1+Shift+<number>\r\n           Move window
  to workspace <number>.\r\n\r\n       Mod1+f\r\n           Toggle fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\n
  \      Mod1+h\r\n           Enable stacking layout for the current container.\r\n\r\n
  \      Mod1+e\r\n           Enable default layout for the current container.\r\n\r\n
  \      Mod1+Shift+Space\r\n           Toggle tiling/floating for the current window.\r\n\r\n
  \      Mod1+t\r\n           Select the first tiling window if the current window
  is floating\r\n           and vice-versa.\r\n\r\n       Mod1+Shift+q\r\n           Kills
  the current window. This is equivalent to \"clicking on the\r\n           close
  button\", meaning a polite request to the application to close\r\n           this
  window. For example, Firefox will save its session upon such a\r\n           request.
  If the application does not support that, the window will\r\n           be killed
  and it depends on the application what happens.\r\n\r\n       Mod1+Shift+r\r\n           Restarts
  i3 in place (without losing any windows, but the layout).\r\n\r\n       Mod1+Shift+e\r\n
  \          Exits i3."
