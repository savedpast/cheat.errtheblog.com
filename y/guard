  in\n      the Guardfile, and then quits Guard itself.\n\n  - reload: reload|r|z
  + return\n      Calls each guard's #reload method, in the same order they are declared\n
  \     in the Guardfile.\n\n  - pause: pause|p + return\n      Toggle files modification
  listening. Useful when switching git branches.\n\n  - run_all: just return (no commands)\n
  \     Calls each guard's #run_all method, in the same order they are declared\n
  \     in the Guardfile.\n\nreload and run_all actions can be scoped to only run
  on a certain guard or\ngroup:\n\n  - backend reload + return\n      Call only each
  guard's #reload method on backend group.\n\n  - rspec + return\n      Call only
  rspec guard's #run_all method."
