symfony_freeze: ! "Deploying Symfony 1.4 project\r\n\r\nIn your config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php
  change the require_once statement for sfCoreAutoload class. Make it search for symfony
  in lib/vendor/symfony:\r\n\r\nrequire_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/../lib/vendor/symfony/lib/autoload/sfCoreAutoload.class.php';\r\n\r\nNow
  you can do two things:\r\n\r\n    * Copy whole symfony lib into lib/vendor/symfony
  dir. This way you always have symfony with your project. Drawback is you have to
  copy it while sending files to the server.\r\n    * Create lib/vendor/symfony symbolic
  link pointing to your symfony lib. Advantage is you don't have to copy whole framework
  all the time. Drawback is you still have to put symfony in the same location on
  dev and production servers. However, symbolic link might be relative to the project
  (i.e. one level up).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             dp
