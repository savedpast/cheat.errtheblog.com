  is a brilliant system for collaborative\nlearning. If you are good natured, you
  can contribute to this \"flowing\nriver\" in a way that benefits all.\n\nI have
  fallen in love with cheat <cheat-sheet-name> --add and --edit.\nIt publishes your
  changes instantly. It is more useful than Wiki, IMO.\n\nBack to lilutils.\n\n1-
