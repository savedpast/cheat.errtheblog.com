zsh_startup: ! "The Startup Process\n\n(In the below description, zsh looks for user
  startup files in the user's home directory by default. \nTo make it look in another
  directory, set the parameter ZDOTDIR to where you'd like zsh to look.)\n\nWhen zsh
  starts up, the following files are read (in order):\n\n\t1. First, read /etc/zshenv
  (If the RCS option is unset in this system file, all other startup files are skipped.)\n\t2.
  Next, read ~/.zshenv\n\t3. Next, IF the shell is a login shell, read /etc/zprofile,
  followed by ~/.zprofile\n\t4. Next, IF the shell is interactive, read /etc/zshrc,
  followed by ~/.zshrc\n\t5. Finally, if the shell is a login shell, read /etc/zlogin,
  followed by ~/.zlogin"
