cheat_sheets_om: ! "Hi, welcome to cheat (http://cheat.errtheblog.com).\nThanks for
  trying it out.  \n\nHere are a few commands to get you started.\n===========================================\n\nInstallation:\n$
  gem install cheat\n\nRecently added cheat sheets:\n$ cheat recent\n\nAll cheat sheets:\n$
  cheat sheets\n\nThe `strftime' cheat sheet:\n$ cheat strftime\n\nView a cheat sheet
  in TextMate:\n$ cheat strftime | mate\n\nLess or more, for scrolly terminal:\n$
  cheat strftime | less\n$ cheat strftime | more\n\nPrint a cheat sheet\n$ cheat strftime
  | lpr\n\nTo edit a cheat sheet, use the --edit switch.\n$ cheat markaby --edit\n\nTo
  add a cheat sheet, use the --add switch.\n$ cheat readme --add\nDo you not use CAPITAL
  letters in the name, or it will be lost in the void, due\nto cheat bugs.\n\nTo use
  a different editor (such as TextMate) for --edit and --add, set the\nVISUAL (or
  EDITOR) environment variable:\n$ export VISUAL='mate -w'\n\nTo see versions of a
  sheet, use the --versions switch.\n$ cheat rspec --versions\n\nTo see a diff to
  the current version, use the --diff switch.\n$ cheat rspec --diff 5\n\nTo see a
  diff between two versions, use the start:end format.\n$ cheat rspec --diff 5:7\n\nSheets
  are cached locally in ~/.cheat.  To clear your cache, pass --new to\ncheat.  You
  won't get updates unless you do this.\n$ cheat --new\n$ cheat strftime --new\n\nAnd
  to get all cached locally, you could do\n$ cheat sheets | grep '^  ' | xargs -n
  1 cheat\n\n(Actually this is likely to fail because the cheatsheets are paged, so
  you'll have to sit and hit [SPACE] whenever the pager (more or less) stops the sheet
  after a screenful, and 'q' when the cheatsheet is done.  Try reducing your terminal's
  font size to almost nothing (Command - on OS X) and setting your terminal window
  to a large size.  This works around the problem to some extent.)"
